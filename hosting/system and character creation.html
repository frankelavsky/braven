			<p class="Title">Introduction</p>
			<p class="Body">The purpose of this book is to provide everything necessary for creating a solid, compelling character for a player to play. This guide has an incredible amount of content that allows virtually everything about a character to be customized, based on the fantasy setting of Braven.</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;That being said, creating a character can be intimidating. There are a lot of parts that have to be assembled, and depending on how custom a player wishes their character to be, it can take a long time. This guide is divided into two main sections: contents and methods. The contents section contains all of the detailed information for creating a character, broken down into categories. For players who are new to Braven Games, taking a look at the methods section is a better place to start than simply jumping right into all of the content. But for those who are the more curious, wandering types, feel free to begin wherever.</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;If you the reader have never before picked up a role-playing game like this before, then fear not! You are in for a wild ride. Remember this advice (before you get in over your head with the complex stuff): the purpose of all of the math, vocabulary, and rules… is to promote fun, challenge, and a sense of story, all of which should be compelling and interesting. This game, with its robust system, ultimately attempts to create a game that balances a feeling of ludicrous luck, challenge, and meaningful narrative. If the rules get in the way of that, then simply focus on being creative. Leave keeping track of all of the rules to a player (or the host) who likes that sort of thing.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Narrative vs Systematic &#9;</p>
			<p class="Body">In Braven, there are two types of things that are commonly referred to: Narrative and systematic. These are adjectives that describe an incredibly important difference in tabletop gaming: the difference between story-telling and rules (essentially). Narrative or systematic might refer to the kind of statement that a player could make. For example, “I conjure the potion” is a narrative statement, but “I use my alchemy lore to do so” is a systematic clarification (the player wishes for the host to know how the potion is conjured, using what ability of the character). Narrative refers to the acting or the role-playing, where systematic refers to the rules or the system of the game.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Host? Player? Character?</p>
			<p class="Body">There are two “roles” that can be filled by a person who plays this game: the Host, and a Player. The host’s job is to know all systematic rules as best as they can (or at least know where to look them up, if they have to) while simultaneously providing a narrative foundation for the players. The host is also expected to translate the systematic stuff into understandable narrative terms for the players such as, “your roll failed by 13 points, so you fall down the stairs and break your nose on the railing on your way to the ground.” The player’s priority is to focus on the narrative aspects of gameplay, while trying (whenever possible) to learn the system, so that the narrative might move along more smoothly, such as, “I attempt to glide down the stairs on my shield, using Agility to do so. My Agility total is 4.”</p>
			<p class="Body">The Host is the person who (hopefully) has a good grasp on all of the game’s rules, the game’s story, the environment and world of Braven, and who wants to do as their name suggests: host a game for others to play. The host is comparable to a DM, GM, or other kinds of “master” that you might find when playing a tabletop role-playing game. The Host should be focused on providing a framework, or skeleton, for a story to grow onto. The Host is the one who introduces the concepts of Destiny, Challenge, and Opportunity to the players, while also handling the rules. Of course, the Host is also responsible for playing all of the Non-Player Characters (NPCs) that the players might encounter in their story. For more information on the Host and what they are expected to do, see the booklet Braven Games: The Host’s Guide.</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;The Player is the person who attempts to fill the role of a character (or sometimes characters) in a game world. Players generally invest a lot of time and energy into the development of their favorite character’s story and abilities. Players “role-play” their character. However, it should be noted that there is a difference between the player and the character. While a player might say the words, “I decide to find the smithy,” it is their character who accomplishes this in the game-world. And conversely, when a character must pass a difficulty check (or make any sort of roll at all), it is their player that accomplishes this task. And while this verbiage might seem obvious to some, it is a point that is sometimes confusing for new players. Think of this as acting in a play. Bianca might be playing Juliet in a production of Romeo and Juliet, perhaps even so deeply engrossed in her acting at times that she would appear or feel to be the same as the character, but their actual selves are quite obviously not the same. </p>
			<p class="Body">When playing the game, a player’s first (and sometimes only) focus should simply be trying to act like their character would in a given situation. Players are not recommended to over-evaluate the rules, stats, or possible loopholes for their character or in the game-system. Some players might find this fun to do, in and of itself, but this is generally not a socially fun tactic when playing Braven in groups. Of course, players are encouraged to be creative, intelligent, and tactical, but these things should never come at too high of a cost to the fun for everyone involved. Players are always most effective when they primarily focus on what they want their character do and then communicating that to the host and other players. The job of the host is to translate a character’s actions through the rules and numbers, and then explain those things in narrative terms, whenever a player is not able (but especially when a player is new to the game). More experienced players are encouraged to help the host with math and rules insofar as they do not overtly cheat, lie, or subvert the game in any way. (For example, a new player might simply say “I kill the evil guy” or “I want to kill the evil guy.” A more experienced player, who knows that there are a few steps and some luck involved, might say, “I swing my axe at the evil guy’s head, spending 6 potential.” A very experienced player might already know the total for their attack, the specific gift they wanted to use, and possibly even a few tricks to make their evil-guy-killing more effective.) Moral of the story? Have fun, focus on telling your part of the story, and you will get used to the rest of things. For more information on how to be a player, see the booklet Braven Games: The Player’s Handbook.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">How do you get started?</p>
			<p class="Body">So, those things being said, this guide serves to help both hosts and players create new characters to play. This guide contains all of the necessary content for creating a character as well as several helpful methods that can make character creation customizable based on a player’s exposure to Braven (or role-playing games in general).</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;Below are 3 ways that someone could create a character.</p>
			<p class="Body">Persona [10-20 minutes]: Only starting Personality is chosen so that the player can test-drive an example character first.</p>
			<p class="Body">Homework Character [1-2 hours + 30 minutes creation]: Player takes a sheet home and fills it out with all the details they want. Host then double-checks for costs and possibility upon completion of the homework sheet.</p>
			<p class="Body">Marathon Character [2-4 hours]: Everything is chosen, step by step, all at once.</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;The section that follows this introduction is the contents section. The following section will contain all of the information needed (all of the parts possible) for creating a character. Characters have incredible potential for diversity, so the contents section is large. For players who are new to Braven, it is recommended that they read the methods section before diving into depths of the content section.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Character Contents</p>
			<p class="Body">This section of the guide is dedicated to all of the information and stats related to anything and everything a player or host would need to create a character. Essentially, all the stuff is here in this section. (The methods for easily assembling all of this information can be found in later sections. See the table of contents for specific page numbers.)</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;Now, it should be noted that many of the methods found in the methods section have shortcut-style information. The information found in the methods section might be incomplete or simply meant to summarize some of the information found in this section. The player and host are always encouraged to look at the contents section to find the final values and data related to whatever option or aspect they have just chosen for their character before finalizing anything.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Contents Summary</p>
			<p class="Body">The contents are organized into sub-sections, each sub-section containing its own type of information. The sub-sections are as follows: </p>
			<p class="Body">Stats, Arts, State, Explained: This section will explain the various stats, arts, and state (with a few other things) of a character. These terms define a character’s capabilities into mathematics, so that players can have a good idea of whatever their character is good or not at doing (for example, a player who has a +10 bonus to Awareness is going to perform better at perceiving things than if they did not). While each character will eventually have their own values for all of these terms, their uses will be explained here briefly.</p>
			<p class="Body">Ethnicities: Ethnicities (referred to in many role playing games as “races”) are the various types of genetic or cultural lineages that a character could hail from. (However, ethnicity is used in this book generally to refer to the genetic lineage of a character.) Some ethnicities excel at certain things, due to their exposure or genetics, so choosing an ethnicity is not just about aesthetics (although, looking and feeling a certain way is important for making a solid character too).</p>
			<p class="Body">Professions: Professions are the jobs that a character could have. Generally, a player only chooses one profession for their character (even though many people have done many things in their lives), simply based on whatever their character has spent most of their time doing. Professions, more than anything else, build a character’s starting Arts and Gifts. Obviously, a character being a blacksmith for 10 years is going to be much different than a character who has spent their whole life as a tribal shaman. Professions are the greatest way for a player to build their character’s history.</p>
			<p class="Body">Cultures: Cultures, also referred to as societies or nationalities (depending on the place), refers to the socio-cultural environment that a character comes from. More important than where the character might presently be at when the gameplay begins, culture would refer to whatever socio-cultural environment influenced the character the most. To rephrase that as a question: Where is the character from? Choosing a culture can say a lot about a character, whether in narrative terms, or systematic.</p>
			<p class="Body">Personalities: Quite shamelessly, “personalities” were developed as a fusion of several different personality tests that exist out there today (in the real world, that is). That being said, there are eight different personalities that a player can choose for their character. Ttheir character’s personality says a lot about both how their character will progress as they level but also how the character might be expected to act. Personalities can change after character creation, but it isn’t easy. However, after the character’s profession, nothing defines the character as much as their personality. And even with enough time (leveling, questing, fame, exposure, etc) a character’s personality becomes just about the most important thing about them. New players, especially those who are unexposed to acting or pretending of any kind, are simply encouraged to choose their own (actual, real-life) personality and simply play their character as some kind of avatar of themselves.</p>
			<p class="Body">Miscellaneous Options: These options can include anything from sex, gender, and sexual preference, age, height, weight, eye color, hair color, skin color, etc. Miscellaneous options do often affect gameplay, but the effect is almost always narrative, not systematic. For example, sexuality plays a significant role in people’s lives, but there are not any explicit rules on how gender, sexuality, or related topics actually play out systematically. So, when a character who is straight walks into a gay bar, it might not give them some kind of negative or bonus outright, but if they were to encounter an assassin who kills straight people, it might not bode well. So that being said, sexism and other sex and gender related biases play a part in the game. Eye color? Maybe not so much, but it still might be fun to mention. Also included in this section are Biases, or opportunities for the character to build plot points, making sometimes disadvantageous (or advantageous?) decisions. Biases are not really required for a character to have, but it is an easy way for the Host to award players plot points based on convincing, compelling, and complex gameplay decisions.</p>
			<p class="Body">Shape: Shape is a concept that governs the uniqueness and customizability of a character. Shape points are a currency that are spent by a player (primarily at character creation, although also in smaller amounts as a character levels) in order to purchase unique abilities, extra skill in arts, or special bonuses for their character. Some shape options may only be chosen at character creation, in order to explain a character’s background (and how exactly they have a +15 sword made of silver or are really attuned to nature, for example). Among the options that can only be chosen at character creation are disadvantages. Disadvantages grant extra shape points for spending, in exchange for permanent disabilities for the character (such as fat fingers, or poor navigation skills). The shape options that may be purchased at any time are labelled as such.</p>
			<p class="Body">Gifts: Gifts are special moves or techniques that a character learns once they become skilled enough at specific arts. Gifts are purchased using gift points, and they are primarily a way for a character to become more powerful in a customizable way as they progress in level.</p>
			<p class="Body">Items: This sub-section outlines everything that a player or host would need to know about the items in the world of Braven. The items system is quite robust, allowing for many things to be made from a combination of materials and designs, although many items are premade for easier access. To note, items are generally chosen and made (if need be) last, simply because all other resources are more important to allocate first.</p>
			<p class="Body">Stats, Arts, State: Explained</p>
			<p class="Body">(Other stuff too!)</p>
			<p class="Body">So basically, I will write more here later. This text is a placeholder. </p>
			<p class="Body">In a nutshell:</p>
			<p class="Body">Stats: These are like categories. They are abstract-mathematical representations of a character’s different abilities, in a broad sense. These govern many different things. Essentially: High numbers are a good thing, low numbers mean that your character isn’t very good at that sort of stuff.</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;The four stats are:</p>
			<p class="Body">Physique: This is your character’s physical strength, toughness, and health. Basically, physique is the constitution of your character’s body.</p>
			<p class="Body">Prowess: This is your character’s ability to coordinate their body, whether through speed, precision, balance, or flexibility. This is generally understood as how graceful your character is, or literally how much swag they have.</p>
			<p class="Body">Wits: Wits are a combination of three things: knowledge, intelligence, and intuition. So, while all of these are quite different things in their own right, they are all related to your character’s brain-power.</p>
			<p class="Body">Prestige: Prestige is a character’s social ability, to put it simply. And while it would be convenient to believe that prestige is simply your character’s only needed tool socially, social actions are actually quite complex in their own right.</p>
			<p class="Body">Arts: Arts are all of the sub-categories from stats, organized according to their governing stats. Arts are things that increase as a character gets better, and they allow a character to specialize (while stats increasing as broader effect on a character’s ability). Arts are increased in three ways primarily: through stat increase, by receiving bonuses, and by increasing skill.</p>
			<p class="Body">Stat increase: As stats increase, all of the arts that the stat “governs” also increase. While this amount is minor, it does effect large amounts of arts at a time, generally making the character more rounded (better at multiple things at once in each stat-category).</p>
			<p class="Body">Bonuses: Take heed to notice whether or not an art receives a bonus from something (such as an item, shape purchase, or ethnic bonus) or a skill. Bonus refers to something that simply gives the player an advantage to performing that art (such as a smithing hammer that gives a bonus to smithing), as opposed to the character actually practicing the art in order to improve. Bonuses tend to be easier to acquire than stat increases and skill increases, but bonuses do not have multiple uses like skill and stat increases do. Stats increase large numbers of arts in small amounts, while skills increase specific arts and also (when certain thresholds of skill are reached in an art) allow for gifts to be purchased (powerful techniques or moves that make a character very effective). Bonuses simply make the character better at doing the art, whatever that might be.</p>
			<p class="Body">Skill increase: Skill in an art is perhaps one of the most important concepts to understand, for those that are new to Braven. Skill in an art literally can be understood as how much the character has actually used and practiced the art. Skill, as it increases, not only numerically makes the character better at performing the actions of the art, but it also allows for gifts (special techniques and abilities) to be purchased once the prerequisite amount of skill has been reached. For example, at +5 skill in Inscription the character will be able to purchase the gift Direct I, which allows them to cast magic using glyphs and runes (very important if a player wants to use magic!).</p>
			<p class="Body">State: State is the summary of all of your character’s body’s resources: stamina, health, and sanity.</p>
			<p class="Body">Stamina: Stamina is like energy or will, it is the thing that keeps a character going. If stamina runs out, the character passes out, their body gives up. Stamina regenerates quickly, but is expended in large amounts. Stamina is lost from damage, mostly, but is sometimes also a resource that the character spends in order to perform special actions (such as sprinting or using certain gifts).</p>
			<p class="Body">Health: Health is literally like the volume of blood, organs, or flesh in a character’s body. Health is meant to feel like a very concrete (non-abstract) resource; it directly correlates to a character’s size and blood volume. Characters have a death health, which is the maximum amount of health that they can lose before they die (think in terms of blood loss). After death health, each major bodily section has its own maximum health. An arm can be destroyed if its health reaches zero, but if a player’s death (or even head) health reaches zero they could die as well. Health is a precious resource, typically lost only in small amounts, but it is regained very slowly.</p>
			<p class="Body">Sanity: Sanity is the mental constitution of a character. Sanity, unlike health and stamina, has a static maximum and nothing can change that value. Sanity is a resource that is lost when emotionally or psychologically traumatic events happen to the character or when the character uses certain kinds of magic. Sanity is precious, because it slowly regenerates in time, making it a difficult resource to manage. Sanity should always have a fragile, almost delicate feel to it. When sanity reaches or goes below zero, characters may become traumatized or resort to coping mechanisms. For more information on sanity, see the player’s handbook or the host’s guide.</p>
			<p class="Body">Other stuff: There are other things that a character uses, such as gifts, gift points, plot points, experience points, and many other things. For more information on these resources, see the player’s handbook or the host’s guide. These are not explicitly discussed in this book because they are not directly related to character creation. Gifts, gift points, shape, and shape points will be explained further in later sections, however.</p>
			<p class="Title">Ethnicities</p>
			<p class="Body">Ethnicities (referred to in many role playing games as “races”) are the various types of genetic or cultural lineages that a character could hail from. (However, ethnicity is used in this book generally to refer to the genetic lineage of a character.) Some ethnicities excel at certain things, due to their exposure or genetics, so choosing an ethnicity is not just about aesthetics (although, looking and feeling a certain way is important for making a solid character too).</p>
			<p class="Body">These tables below are referred to as the Ethnicity-Related Bonuses to Stats and Vitality. These are the basic bonuses that each ethnicity grants to a character. </p>
			<p class="Body">The following information is referred to as Cultural Advantages and Disadvantages. These bonuses include the starting shape points that a character might receive, as well as other more unique bonuses. This information also includes the various sub-cultures, labels, and even slurs used to refer to the diverse types of people found from each cultural background.</p>

The character can gain their resistances through experiences in life, personal choice, or just genetics (whatever the player wants for their character).

These are the result of a plethora of things that make up the character’s background and don’t necessarily have to be explained by any one thing. Explaining how your character developed to have these stats should make sense with the other decisions the player makes when crafting their character and can range from genetics to chance to lifestyle choices (or whatever crafts the background story you’re interested in).</p>

Social Standing should ideally be explained in a way that really enriches the character’s backstory and experiences so far in life. Some social standings have Disadvantages (see the Starting Shape section).</p>

			<p class="Title">Choosing your Culture</p>
			<p class="Body">Cultures are divided into <span class="Bold">9 different political archetypes</span> across two different scales, as shown in the figure above. </p>
			<p class="Body">Cultures near the top of the scale have more stringent laws and traditions and are less welcoming of outsiders. Cultures near the bottom value autonomy, consent, and voluntary participation (so their members tend to be both more welcoming and less committed).</p>
			<p class="Body">Cultures near the left of the scale share resources among their members according to the needs of those members. Wealth is distributed for the benefit of all. These cultures only trade and barter with outsiders. Cultures near the right of the scale treat members and outsiders equal in transactions. Wealth is accumulated by the few.</p>
			<p class="Body">Each Culture is some kind of society, nationality, state, tribe, or general organization of people with a place and history. Some have borders, while others do not. But every culture can be “grown up in” and those who live in it are part of its history.</p>
			<p class="Body">Culture shapes how people think and act, and likewise grants a small bonus to stats. (These bonuses are noted above.) In addition, every culture also has different languages that they speak.</p>
			<p class="Body">Contrary to many popular role-playing games, Braven does not espouse racial essentialism. Braven is a game that explores behavioral and constructivist ideas, like how the environment you grew up in shaped your character into the person they begin their adventure as. </p>
			<p class="Body">(If you really want to role-play <span class="Italic">race</span> as something meaningful to your character, feel free to distribute your Basic Stats according to this idea of yours. Those points are meant for whatever explanation you want to give.)</p>
			<p class="Body">More detailed information on cultures, nations, and societies can be found later in this guide in the Cultures sub-section. That section includes history, politics, laws, cities, regions, maps, and other such information. The information in this sub-section only serves to outline necessary bonuses for making a character.</p>
			<p class="Title">Languages: </p>
			<p class="Body">(Note: The most common language is Colonial.) Language is an important part of the social aspect of gameplay. Many cultures speak different languages, making culturally diverse parties essential at times. </p>
			<p class="Body">Language proficiency is ordered based on Ranks. Rank 1 in a language is considered rough, broken, and basic. Communication at Rank 1 is simple, slow, and sometimes confusing. Characters receive -50 to Charisma, Authority, and any maneuvers attempting to understand someone else. Rank 2 in a language is considered loosely conversational, but accents and dialects are not represented in the character’s speech. More complicated ideas and terms are not understandable. Characters receive -25 to Charisma, Authority, and any maneuvers attempting to understand someone else. Rank 3 in a language is considered to be indistinguishable from a native speaker. While all accents or dialects may not be known, many (or at least one) are understood by the character. Characters have no negatives when communicating at Rank 3.  </p>
			<p class="Body">Note: Characters with a starting Wits of 25 or higher may choose 1 additional rank for free.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Living, Human Languages</p>
			<p class="Body">The following languages are may be selected due to Wits, having the Choice () option due to culture, or by spending Shape Points:</p>

			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">Sign Language*</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-5">Valdar</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-7">*Sign language must be paired with another language because each has its own sign system. Sign language cannot out-rank the language it is paired with.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Dead or Non-Human Languages</p>
			<p class="Body">The following languages are considered extremely specialized and difficult; none are spoken by living, human cultures, except for remarkable or miraculous outliers. Generally, these languages require spells or physiology not natural to humans to use. If the host allows it, players may purchase these for their characters if they are able to explain it in a way that makes sense with the larger story that is being told.</p>
			<p class="Body">So, in additional to normal allowance (Shape Points, Choice option, or Wits award), each rank gained requires Plot Points to be spent in order to understand someone else who uses it. Plot points must be spent <span class="Italic">again</span> in order to also be able to communicate in that language. </p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Dark-Tongue</p>
			<p class="Body">This language originates from the Realm of Shadow and is more about movement and one’s position, relative to light than it is about sounds. Much of the language requires no sounds at all, but triangulation within one’s environment.</p>

			<p class="Title">Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Professions are the jobs that a character could have. Generally, a player only chooses one profession for their character (even though many people have done many things in their lives), simply based on whatever their character has spent most of their time doing. Professions, more than anything else, build a character’s starting Arts and Gifts. Obviously, a character being a blacksmith for 10 years is going to be much different than a character who has spent their whole life as a tribal shaman. Professions are the greatest way for a player to build their character’s history.</p>
			<p class="Body"> </p>
			<p class="Body">Before we begin…</p>
			<p class="Body">A few things worth mentioning in this section: Generally, these professions are to guide a player. A player is certainly encouraged to invent a profession of their own by choosing a profession listed here that is perhaps close enough to their liking and then adding to it with their remaining shape points. It should be noted that a player is required to choose a profession, but they can rename the profession of their choice to whatever they want. (Players cannot just invent one from scratch, but the Host could do so if they care to invest the time.) Professions with the least amount of things pre-chosen have, naturally, the most shape points remaining for the player to customize their character. The standard profession that allows the most possible customizing is the Homedweller – Youth, but it also received no discounted shape purchases (see below for rules on shape discounts for professions). Generally, I do not recommend that players be allowed to customize the actual profession’s bonuses, simply because that always becomes a cumbersome and tedious process. If the Host is willing, they can allow it (of course), or the Host can do it themselves. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the Host chooses to customize or create new professions, they should reference the discount rules below. The discounts offered here are only available because players should be encouraged to choose between premade options, rather than fully customizing their character from scratch. Hosts should be encouraged not to create new professions for their players on a case-by-case basis, due to the time consumption of the process and the potential unfairness. I will reiterate: Professions have discounts to skills primarily to encourage players not to overly customize, but to choose a profession that is premade. That being said, the rules that were used in creating all of the following professions, as well as any new professions if the Host chooses, are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Body">Core Skills: +5 Skill is granted to three different Arts and the cost is free.</p>
			<p class="Body">Starting Gifts: Gifts with 5 Skill requirement cost 2 Shape, Gifts with 10 Skill requirement cost 4 Shape</p>
			<p class="Body">Shape Choices: </p>
			<p class="Body">Shape Purchases from the “Starting Shape” advantages category cost one less shape point than normal. If the purchase only costs one normally, then it is worth half of a point and rounds up. (Effectively, two single-point items may be taken for one point. One single-point item, or odd numbered single-point items costs one point.)</p>
			<p class="Body">Shape Purchases from the disadvantages category grant one more shape point than normal. </p>
			<p class="Body">Shape Purchases from the “Improvements” category simply do not increase the cost of future improvements like a normal purchase would. (For example: if a profession grants +5 Skill to several different Arts, each +5 only costs 4 Shape, and they do not increase the costs for the character’s first purchase of the Practiced Art improvement.)</p>
			<p class="Body">Other guidelines: Hosts are strongly encouraged not to create a profession that gives any advantage or improvement to anything other than skill or bonus to Arts or contributes to the purchase of a Gift. The only exception to this would be purchases in the Starting Shape: Basic Advantages category. Also, generally the only disadvantages that a profession should offer are an increase in starting level or a bounty. Generally professions do not offer too specific of customization. The player is encouraged to customize their character’s INI, PT, Stats, Plot Points, Health, items and other aspects themselves.</p>
			<p class="Body">When choosing a profession, if it says (See: [other profession]), then the player may choose either of the categories for their character’s profession’s technical title. For example, if a character wished to be a Tribal – Trader, they would have to reference Merchant – General for their starting stats and bonuses. The character may consider either of those titles for their profession. Why is this relevant? For example, say the character wants to be from a society where Tribal – Trader is not a common profession, even though Merchant – General is. The character may keep the title and category for Tribal – Trader or Merchant – General in order to receive the common or uncommon bonuses for their profession. (To note: they still must receive the profession-related starting bonuses from Merchant – General.) Of course, they might also want to explain how they are a Tribal Trader in the Kingdom of Tacklesbard (or whatever), but that is a narrative matter and up to them. </p>
			<p class="Body"> </p>
			<p class="Title">Artisan Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Artisans are people whose profession it is to create things or master an Art. They tend to be driven, sensitive, and skilled in a specific profession, such as Cooking or Blacksmithing.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Apprentice</p>
			<p class="Body">Apprentices are generally unskilled in a specific craft or profession, but have spent enough time to learn some basics Arts that would aid them in just about any trade. The player must specify their character’s secondary Art in some form or another (rope-making, carpentry, leatherworking, etc.).</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Courtesan</p>
			<p class="Body">A courtesan, also called a companion (if a member of the Companion’s Guild), is an independent prostitute who makes their living selling their body for sexual activity. Differentiated from prostitutes proper (who are considered slaves, due to their difficult and stratified status), courtesans are owned by no one. A courtesan is said to practice “courting,” rather than referring to their work as “prostitution.” Courtesans tend to work in small guilds, unions, or groups together and sell their services to typically wealthier members of society. Some courtesans travel with wealthy merchants in order to broaden and diversify their customer base, while others might simply serve only one customer. Courtesans are considered legal in every major nation after prostitutes organized significant political action in favor of legalization, a movement called the Whore’s March. After removing the illegal status of practicing prostitution, life conditions significantly improved for many practicing courtesans. Within the Whore’s March movement was the creation of the Companion’s Guild. The Companion’s Guild was originally a group of prostitutes who stood with each other in solidarity and disclosed to the public the lawmakers, legislators, politicians, nobles, and rulers who frequented their services. After this information was made public, it became clear to lawmakers that it was in their best interest to legalize prostitution. The Companion’s Guild eventually became a union for courtesans who possess a high-profile portfolio of customers and wish to organize for more political and social power. Despite still great moral resistance for their practices in some circles, courtesans are generally very powerful individuals, respected for their practice and history.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Templar</p>
			<p class="Body">Templars are knights-by-honor (noble birth is not required when they are knighted) who serve the Holy Body in one of three ways: either in small teams protecting holy sites and relics, serving as officers in the Holy Body, or as Preceptors at a college or university, training young Paladins and Templars in the ways of holy warfare. Templars have gone through the same training as Paladins and succeeded them in training in order to pursue the Templar’s Path, a rigorous 3-year training that prepares them for one of their three roles. A player may choose Templar if they wish to be considered for another religious group’s holy guardship (although they would not be considered proper “Templars” should they choose this option, and do not get the free Templar’s Broach and Tabard). High Templars are a rank that is one above a Templar, and they specifically are charged either with protecting the Halls of the Grand Sanctuary or they work alongside an inquisitor (officiate wizard) as the hand of justice who slays or captures apostates and sorcerers. A high templar has the same stats as a regular templar, they just have more specific roles.</p>

For the most part, priests, paladins, scientists, scribes, templars, and wizards who do not have their license or proof of profession are more than likely still a student. Also to note: while a character’s profession might be as an instructor in some form, they would actually reference their proper professional field for their bonuses (for example, Preceptors would reference Church – Templar).</p>

			<p class="Title">Knight Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">A Knight is a warrior, typically of noble birth, who has dedicated their life to the service and protection of their Lady or Lord instead of seeking the comfortable life of a noble. Knights typically swear an oath of fealty and chastity in order to serve their master without any distractions. Knights, aside from squires or templars, are of noble birth. Typically, however, a knight is someone who was from a lesser family or not an heir to their own family’s wealth and power, and thus chose instead to serve.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Errant</p>
			<p class="Body">A Knight-Errant is a knight whose purpose is to travel for their master. Many Ladies and Lords send their errants out so that their name and family can gain fame and fortune in the name of their knight. Some errants have secret missions or very special quests. Many knights choose the Errant’s Path because it allows them virtually all of the social benefits of being a knight (many will listen and yield to them, they are well liked, and they are often given goods and services for free) while keeping them from being too close to the accountability of their master. Despite this, errants are vagabonds and are often poor. They tend to sell their strong arm for the service of others, or many even enlist in the military.</p>

The most common profession for a knight, they often are dually employed: paid by the law as a guard and also paid by a lord to represent strength in local enforcement measures. Many sentries are thought to be more for the political gain of a noble’s ventures, than actually for enforcing or protecting anything. But controversy or theories of spying aside, most all Knight-Guards are as loyal and dedicated as can be.</p>

Many squires swear an oath of fealty to a specific knight and as well as their ruler. Squires who are not of noble birth are the most common, and they are pejoratively referred to often as “Squibs” or “Squibbies” by rival knights or squires of higher birth, as a way of insulting them for being less than a ‘real’ squire.</p>

			<p class="Body">Law professions refer to any character that serves the law. While it is obvious that there are many different legal systems across the many different nations, these categories serve to create examples of the most common or the most iconic professions in this field of work.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Answer</p>
			<p class="Body">Perhaps the most iconic servant of the law is the Tacklesbardian Answer. In other cultures or contexts, a character may choose this profession to refer to themselves as a judge or ruler in legal court. But in Tacklesbard, the Answer is both judge and jury. They sit in seats of three and dispute the outcome of cases with lawyers. Answers are famous and feared across the land because they often decide quickly and harshly how to deal with lawbreakers. However in many cases, criminals never make it to a hearing before an Answer because they cannot afford a lawyer or because their lawyer does not see adequate profit in their case. If a criminal cannot convince a lawyer to represent them, then lower law officials such as Sheriffs or even Guards will decide their fate. To make matters worse, Answers are often investigated by the royal family or other Answers for corruption (being bought out, etc).</p>

			<p class="Body">Bounty hunters who work for the law are the most common sort of bounty hunter, as many dangerous criminals in many regions of Braven are too hard to find and too labor-intensive for local law enforcement to bring in themselves. Bounty hunting is very common in Ballast especially, where bounty hunters are known to represent the only law enforcement at all. (See: Mercenary – Bounty Hunter)</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Ranger</p>
			<p class="Body">Rangers are those who serve to enforce the law by traversing generally uninhabited regions of land. Their job is often rigorous and demanding because they usually deal with rough terrain, searching for criminals on the run. Typically a mix of fighter and tracker, Rangers often are employed by law enforcement when a highly dangerous criminal is on the loose. Rangers rarely bring in their criminals alive, as they are typically sent in small death-squads to eliminate targets. Many nations have international rangers, or law enforcement officers who have universal jurisdiction to hunt and kill Braven’s most wanted enemies. “When they call for us, no one escapes… only those with luck, and lots of it.” – A ranger motto. They are famous for carving or marking “no luck” in trees or nearby places where they caught their marks. International rangers are given special tattoos made from ink that is illegal to produce and extremely rare. This is an identifier that makes rangers easily distinguished, so that other law enforcement officials do not get in their way.</p>

Sheriffs are sometimes elected by a town, among its own members, or chosen by higher legal authority and sent to serve a specific community. Sheriffs almost always are in charge of recruiting their own deputies, which typically leads to alliances with local nobles and the acquisition of squires or knights for their service.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Animals</p>
			<p class="Body">An Animals Doctor, or Veterinarian, is a character whose profession is in the medical care of animals. Most often, vets are employed in rural areas, caring for domesticated animals on large farms. Animal Doctors have to complete schooling at a college in order to be licensed for their work. Veterinarians are fairly uncommon, but always in demand. Because of this, they often charge very high prices for their services.</p>

Due to this, however, counselors are easily the wealthiest of medical professionals. Counselors founded the Board of Medical Licensing and only allow a certain number of active counselor professionals to be licensed at a time. While a character may choose this profession and remain unlicensed, their counseling would be highly illegal and they would either be required to omit the money below or take a Bounty on their head equal to ten times their starting monetary worth. (The Board of Medical Licensing has incredible political power, especially in the northern nations of Braven.)</p>

			<p class="Title">Mercenary Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Mercenaries are, to put it simply, those that are hired to kill things. Mercenaries are considered a legal and completely legitimate profession in every society to some degree. In fact, the southwestern nation of Ballast primarily enforces its capital punishment through the use of bounty hunters. Mercenaries, whether grizzled soldiers or thugs for hire, are strong, tough, and know their way around a weapon at least.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Assassin</p>
			<p class="Body">Assassins are generally not considered Mercenaries, simply because assassins operate outside of legal systems. For real assassins, (See: Outlaw – Assassin) or for a legally-approved assassin, (See: Mercenary – Bounty Hunter or Law - Ranger).</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Bounty Hunter</p>
			<p class="Body">Bounty hunters are very common in the southern and western countries, where most criminal dangers are handled in this manner. Ballast and Chamarolain both do not have prisons for holding criminals, so a death warrant is issued immediately in cases for dangerous individuals. Noturnol and areas to the west of the desert, especially near the Whispering Ridge, house many criminals on the run. For these reasons, business is always in demand for bounty hunters. The northern nations also do employ bounty hunters, but they tend to be government agents instead. If this is the case, (See: Law – Ranger).</p>

However, licensed thugs (literally Thug License) are able to make more money and are even certified in ‘preventative measures’ which allows them to do more than simply defending things.

			<p class="Sub-Header">Specialist</p>
			<p class="Body">Specialists tend to be highly trained infiltrators, spies, scouts, or other agents of subterfuge in the military. Specialists are dangerous, subtle, and skilled in many ways. Virtually every military employs several specialists, and some even operate outside the technical jurisdiction of the military, serving directly under a government organization. Specialists typically operate on the fine line of what is conventionally considered legal or humane, as they are willing to do whatever needs to be done for the victory or success of their mission. Gritty, rugged, stealthy, and lethal are all common denominators of specialists. Unfortunately due to their line of work, they are rarely publicly recognized for their feats.</p>

			<p class="Title">Nobility Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Nobility professions may refer to many different roles that a noble could serve. Nobles are generally born into their nobility, but in some cases (where ruling nobility is not head of the governmental structure), nobility may simply refer to elected officials, leaders, or rulers in different capacities.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Benefactor</p>
			<p class="Body">Benefactors are the fortunate heirs to a noble family, but they are often not required to rule or administer in any way. They are basically just rich and privileged. This profession may be chosen by almost any affluent heir of an upper-class family, whether technically noble or not.</p>

			<p class="Body">Politicians may not technically be considered nobility, but they are often revered and have many responsibilities in the same way as a noble. Politicians are more often than not elected into their roles, and because of that are incredibly charismatic and influential. Politicians tend to err more on the side of ignorance to their people’s needs, because they are typically more concerned with their own election than the issues of their people. (Although this is not always the case, it is the general trend among those who must be elected to rule). Politicians are always known among the people they are serving.</p>

Generally the difference between a ruler and a politician is that a ruler is chosen to govern without contributing to that choosing in any way. Rulers far more often than not really are of noble birth and simply born into their office. Rulers tend to have much knowledge about their people and history and are typically famous among their subjects.</p>

If a player wishes for their character to be an outlaw free of bounty it will cost them shape points equal to the bounty listed for the profession.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Assassin</p>
			<p class="Body">Assassins are those who kill others illegally, typically by contract or for money. Assassins may also be those who capture or kill based on illegally commissioned bounties, or in other words: illegal bounty hunters. Assassins are incredibly dangerous outlaws, and generally rangers are called in to take them out, as opposed to any other form of law enforcement. If a player chooses this profession for their character, they may up their bounty in order to have a Bounty – International: Extremely Dangerous, which grants the character 1 extra Shape Point.</p>

Their crimes could range from assault, disturbing the peace, unguilded or unlicensed practice, mugging, trading minor illegal paraphernalia, etc. For the most part, a player should consider a different profession and simply add a bounty for their character’s crimes instead of choosing a minor criminal (unless their character actually is defined primarily by their minor criminal activity).</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Sorcerer</p>
			<p class="Body">Sorcerers (and sorceresses) are one of the most famous sorts of outlaws because of their controversial, political status. Sorcerers are those who openly practice magic that is deemed illegal. Sorcerers may also refer to apostates. Apostates are specifically wizards who practice magic outside of their license or who still practice magic but have not renewed their license. However, any practice of magic that requires a license is considered illegal if the user does not have the appropriate license. Sorcerers range from educated wizards who have a license but practice outside of their license, wizards who still practice magi with universally illegal magic (magic that is not allowed for anyone to practice), down to those who were never educated in the university but sought the use of magic regardless. The controversy of the sorcerer is that much magic is regarded illegal solely on the principle that the Holy Body has declared it so. Universally illegal magic includes: Pithology (manipulation of bodies and flesh), demonology (magic that interacts with demons), xenocology (miracle-magic that does not require essence), and necromancy (anything that manipulates souls, life, and death). The two illegal magic schools still considered in some way helpful are pithology and xenocology. Many famous wizards were discovered with evidence linking to the research and practice of one of these two schools after their death.</p>

			<p class="Title">Peasant Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Peasants are those who are born into poverty and have little chance of escaping their impoverished lives. They are generally employed as simple laborers, performing difficult grunt work for specialists, professionals, or those more fortunate and skilled. If a peasant isn’t employed as a worker, then they are most likely a beggar. Peasants are most clearly defined by their lack of ownership in any significant form of capital or professional skill. Neither their possessions nor their labor hold much value. Peasants do not own the land they live on, rarely own their own tools, are often underfed and unhealthy, and have little money saved.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Beggar</p>
			<p class="Body">Beggars are perhaps the most unfortunate of people because they make their living off of almsgiving by those who take pity on them. Beggar may also refer to any marginalized person who lives outside. Beggars may be any character whose life is defined by incredible poverty or lack of resources and some inability to work or find labor. Most beggars exist simply because of complex systems of injustice and a lack of available employment. However, there are some beggars who simply refuse to work or cannot work due to physical or psychological disability. Either way, players may choose this profession if their character is unemployed, poor, and lacks mobility.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Worker</p>
			<p class="Body">Workers are those whose profession includes any sort of general labor. Peasant laborers, unfortunately due to systemic and structural injustices, are typically never able to rise above their economic stratus. Thus they are poor laborers their whole lives and even for generations. A player may choose this profession for their character simply if they come from any background as a general laborer, in any field of work.</p>

Some biologists are employed in agricultural and subsistence research practices. Their research is used in medicine, alchemical studies, and the documentation of animals and monsters. Most biologists are employed by colleges or universities, although rarely some are hired by private researching firms. Biologists, no matter what field they choose to work in, are required to pass their Biology vocational exams and graduate from a college, university, or academy.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Engineer</p>
			<p class="Body">‘Engineer’ may refer to any character whose profession is in physics, architecture, engineering, or closely related field. Engineers are almost always scientists employed by large guilds or governments to design and implement infrastructure-related technology in urban areas. The most common job for engineers is in the installation and maintenance of waterways, aqueducts, and Kaladuk’s famous pulley-transport system (for goblins). In fact, most engineers are actually goblins, due to the Far Northern’s lack of reliance on magic and religious powers. Goblin or not, many small-time engineers help rural communities irrigate farmland, build roads, and other related projects. Engineers (of any kind) in order to be certified have to attend a college, university, or academy and pass the final Engineering and Physics vocational exams.</p>

Inventors are rather obscure, and generally work alongside other scientists in their field of specialization. Generally inventors have dual-vocational certification, making them suited for innovating new technologies in whatever field they are pursuing. Some Inventors actually pursue an Alchemy License through a wizarding program as well. For those inventors, (See: Wizard – Alchemy License).</p>

			<p class="Title">Scribe Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Scribes are those who specialize in work that involves written texts. Scribes generally go to a college or university, although it is not necessarily required. Many scribal students learn their work through an apprenticeship instead of schooling. Scribes do not require any special licensing or certificates for their work, although a college or university still grants them a diploma or degree nevertheless. Scribes are among the most literate of citizens and for this reason they are occasionally caught practicing magic without a license. Depending on the society and the university the scribe attended, their degree may so closely resemble a wizarding scholar-license that some dishonest scribes can get away with their practice of magic for a long time. In any case, scholars are more often than not the type who value the preservation of culture, the telling of stories, and the organization of materials.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Chronicler</p>
			<p class="Body">Chroniclers are those who record stories or events as they are happening. Chroniclers are known also as storytellers, reporters, or employees of press publications. Chroniclers are always in high demand, as many do active research on the field in order to inform a society of its inner workings and events. Chroniclers are always either published or simply well known for their storytelling. Chroniclers are sometimes, due to their controversial work at times, targeted by dangerous criminals or illegal organizations for their unveiling work. For the most part, chroniclers are seen as truthful sources of information, although some scandals of misinformation are not entirely unavoidable.</p>

Historians tend to be the most research-oriented scribes, often publishing valuable works that connect events, periods, or people. Historians are rarely self-employed, as they tend to work for universities, museums, governments, or organizations who value research and publication. Some historians have been known to fabricate information, due to biases of their employers. That being said, many historians still strive to reveal truths once lost and stake their claim on scholarship.</p>

			<p class="Title">Slave Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Slaves are those who serve a master without pay or freedom. While slavery is formally illegal in many societies, some are informal in their enforcement of the law. Other societies, on the other hand, still allow for slavery to exist legally. Slaves are almost always seen as an article of property, not a person. Slaves exist from all ethnic backgrounds, but more often than not are either Erawan, Easterner, Bronzeblood, or Hawdorian. People of mixed ethnicity are also highly susceptible to enslavement, especially mixed water dwarves, pale elves, and half-humes. In some rarer occasions, impoverished people will offer themselves as slaves to a local dignitary in return for food, housing, and protection. Ballast is famous for voluntary slavery, as its slaves were primarily not part of the slave trade to begin with. Much of Ballast’s cheap labor is due to profiting off of the local poverty. “Lifetime contracts” for service in exchange for food, shelter, and dignity are sometimes the more appealing option than freedom for the poor, in especially difficult nations. For more information on slavery and societies with slavery, see the detailed Cultures, Societies, Nationalities pages.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">General</p>
			<p class="Body">General slaves are those who are not hard-laborers, warriors, or prostitutes. General slaves are often house-servants, errand-runners, or someone equivalent. General slaves are most often owned by rich masters. General slaves, however, are the most common kind of slave that still exists in countries where slavery is illegal. This is primarily because their work is not easily recognized as slavery; they often live with adequate amenities, making their status loosely considered a “job” with housing and food for wages. For that reason, their situation tends to be overlooked by the law and slavery advocacy groups.</p>

But regardless, many societies still own slaves and laborers are the most common kind of slave. Laborers are employed to do hard work, heavy lifting, and exhausting tasks. Laborers tend to die younger than their masters, rarely living very old due to their hard work. Some governments or royalty own many slaves for the production of the realm.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Prostitute</p>
			<p class="Body">(For guilded or free-practicing prostitutes, See: Artisan – Courtesan). Arguably, no slave has a worse life than a prostitute. Often battered, abused, and diseased, prostitutes tend to die young or are killed if they become too sick to generate income for their owners. Some prostitutes are lucky enough to be purchased as concubines for a lord or in rarer cases as a wife. But for the most part, prostitutes are among the most neglected and marginalized of the world. A few rare havens exist for prostitutes where they are well taken care of, despite their line of work. Some whores when adequately cared for may even enjoy their line of work, though this tends to be a fantasy that is propagated to reduce the guilt in whorehouse patrons. Prostitution is generally one of the most grim situations for a person to find themselves in, and those who profess they enjoy it are more than likely encouraged by management to have such an opinion. </p>

However, some nobles, merchants, and dignitaries do still employ a small number of slaves as personal guards when finding a knight or properly employed guard becomes too burdensome. More often than not, a warrior slave protects a rich person and their stuff. Warrior slaves are sometimes given great dignity and honor for their service, depending on the culture, despite having no personal freedom.</p>

			<p class="Title">Tribal Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">It is difficult to introduce “tribal” professions due to the tacit ethnocentrism of the terminology. That being said, “tribal” refers to characters that are part of a tribe-system of culture or society. Tribal is not meant to be synonymous with “savage” or “underdeveloped” sorts of “primitive” people. Many tribes in Braven remain culturally so by choice, whether they choose to live on the margins of the urbanizing world and complex politics, or they simply are traditionalist people who are keen to see the disadvantages of living a non-tribal way of life. Many bands and tribes still exist, most notably the tribal nations of Djamek and Lucykyand. In those cases, as with others, tribes are known to have complex systems of subsistence production, exchange, and politics. It is hard to consider the tribes “primitive” or “savage” although certainly they are different than urbanizing societies. Some tribes, like Djamek and Lucykyand, have hundreds of thousands of members, split across sub-tribes and bands stretching over giant landmasses. Characters who wish to choose a tribal profession may consider any other profession if it suits their desired arts or abilities better. The following list does not adequately do justice to the many different roles and professions that exist in tribal societies. However, for the sake of shape-point bonuses and the like, only the following professions are actually considered “tribal.”</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Crafter</p>
			<p class="Body">A tribal crafter is any person who concerns themselves primarily with crafting something. They may craft in excess and sell their excesses for trade goods or currency, or they may simply craft for their band or tribe as needed. (See: Artisan – Crafter)</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Gatherer</p>
			<p class="Body">Gatherers are either those who gather or hunt some form of subsistence or resource. They may gather in excess and sell their excesses for trade goods or currency, or (more commonly) gather as needed for their tribe or band. (See: Ranger – Any)</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Leader</p>
			<p class="Body">Tribal leaders are diverse and complex in their style and instantiation as leader. Many different tribes, sub-tribes, or bands have different expectations for their leaders, if they have formally claimed leaders at all. Tribal leaders are also very different in how they are chosen, elected, or brought into their place as leader. For the most part, leaders are well known and respected by their communities and they possess incredible physical and social abilities. Tribal leaders, in general, oversee many military and judicial aspects of their tribe. While some leaders also represent their tribe to other tribes or societies, more commonly a shaman or elder represents them instead.</p>

However, even when visiting most societies where their use of magic is illegal, it is rare for shaman to be apprehended for their practice. Most shaman are deeply respected by their tribe, and often represent the tribe to other tribes or societies instead of the tribal leader, due to their wisdom and presence. Shaman are typically quite old, and incredibly experienced and knowledgeable on a wide variety of subjects. Some universities and colleges have regular guest lectures by shaman on advanced, esoteric topics.</p>

			<p class="Body"> </p>
			<p class="Title">Wandering Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Wanderers are those who wander, to put it simply. Wanderers are often loosely tied to their society of origin, if at all, and more often travel in small groups or alone. Wanderers generally look for adventure, meaning, or a way of life that is not clearly tied to a society proper, but don’t wish to live stationary like a hermit. Some wanderers end up settling somewhere later in life, generally as hermits. But during their time wandering, characters with these professions tend to be contemplative, brave, and observant.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Adventurer</p>
			<p class="Body">Adventurers are those who wander from place to place, looking for adventure. In general, adventurers have few possessions of their own but have enough privilege to somehow remain mobile. In general, adventurers left a place of riches or affluence and maintain their needs through contracts, quests, or the goodwill of others. Many small communities love receiving and sending adventurers. Adventurers are treated like knight errants in a way, but they travel on behalf of their community or themselves, and they obviously don’t take a knight’s vow. Most societies have a culture that helps to sustain adventurers, who generally become transient questers-for-hire, willing to do whatever difficult tasks that locals are not willing to do themselves.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Sage</p>
			<p class="Body">Sages are wanderers who share many similarities in eccentricity and wisdom as a hermit, but are not stationary. Wandering sages are among the most revered of people, as they tend to be seen as holy, blessed, mysterious, and prophetic. But whether a legit holy person, or a skilled poser looking for fame, the stats are still very similar.</p>

			<p class="Body">Transients are perhaps the most general sort of wanderer, simply because they are not particularly focused or skilled in anything. Transients tend to be incredibly marginalized however, which is the leading cause of their wandering. Unlike other wanderers, transients are not easily considered a wanderer simply by choice. Transients are typically unemployed, malnourished, and low in social status. Systemically, transients are a result of extreme social stratification caused by particularly advanced and mobile societies, but they do not benefit from cultural ideologies in the same way that many other impoverished types might (such as the wandering sage, the hermit, and others). Transients are the outsiders, the rejected, and the derelict wanderers who were often born into extreme poverty and given little access to proper ideological, social, and cultural support systems. The player may also wish to choose Peasant – Beggar for a stationary version of the Transient.</p>

			<p class="Title">Wizard Professions</p>
			<p class="Body">Wizards are the licensed, legal practitioners of essence magic and magic-related professions. Essence magic is the most common form of magic that a person is capable of interacting with. Other forms of magic exist, but very few records show any harnessing of that magic, let alone a methodology for doing so. In order to be a licensed wizard, a character must endure difficult schooling, training, and exposure before being approved by the Congregation of International Magic Practitioners (Con-IMP or CIMP for short). The CIMP board was established by an agreement between several governments and the Holy Body in order to regulate the access that citizens had to dangerous magic. With magic being a regular practice of the church, the Holy Body was interested in a system that allows training for their priests but is not detrimental to the safety of society. Originally just a council within the church, eventually partnerships with governments led to the majority of nations in Braven adopting laws that require any and all practitioners of non-elementary magic to be licensed. Thus, CIMP was formed. Some magic is legal for private use, but any magic (direct use or even affiliation with magic-related materials) in the public sphere requires a license. Wizards range in their licensure and by their 2nd year of schooling at a college or university must decide on their specific track of study. Most colleges are quite expensive, but notably the two most prestigious colleges in Braven, Wycliffe of Gamin University and Von Bora Hall in Lamoor, are free. The stipulations for the free colleges are that applicants must pass rigorous “Talent Exams” and several interviews in order to be admitted, and often the students agree to spend the first several years after their licensing contributing to research for the college. In other words, only those with notable talent or considerable wealth ever make it into a wizarding program (let alone finish). Unlicensed wizards are called sorcerers and sorceresses. Wizards who do not renew their licensing but continue their practice of magic are called apostates. Unlicensed and illegal magic of any kind is called sorcery. A wizard’s license is the book that they are issued, so if a wizard is practicing magic without their book handy, they could get in trouble. In any case, whether practitioners of magic or those who buy and sell items deemed magical, wizards are among the most educated and dangerous citizens of Braven.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Alchemy Licensed</p>
			<p class="Body">A wizard with an alchemy license could practice in a variety of ways. Because the category of Alchemy could apply to medicine, potions, gases, or solids and any implementation of, alchemists have a variety of practices. Typically alchemists employ transmutation, conjuration, manipulation, or fusion magic to create or change inanimate substances. Due to their practice and access to specific spells, alchemists are the most common wizard caught practicing the illegal use of pithology (organic transmutation, conjuration, manipulation, or fusion). Alchemists are often employed working with doctors, creating the necessary potions or medicines or employed working in research at a school or private firm, developing new substances, materials, or chemicals.</p>

			<p class="Body">Apprentice wizards are those who are studying to be a wizard, but are not yet licensed. Typically they are referred to as a Novice. (See: College – Novice)</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Chandler Licensed</p>
			<p class="Body">Chandler license wizards, called Chandlers, Brokers, or Dealers, are easily the richest of all the wizards, because they are the only wizards who deal in magical goods and services. While spells, magical items, and dangerous materials can be freely traded between wizards, magical goods that pass hands to non-licensed folks must be approved and modified by a chandler-wizard. Much of the work of a chandler is disenchanting, re-enchanting, or enchantment-modification of magical items in order to make the items sellable to the public. Even though wizards are permitted to trade among each other for magical items or other services, most wizards still visit a trusted chandler, as they tend to have networks and connections (due to their work) that other wizards do not. Chandlers, interestingly enough, are also the only wizards who construct and make official the standard-issue license-books for priests and wizards. Many wizards make their living simply producing these works, or special versions thereof, under the approval of the CIMP board. Chandlers are technically allowed to have any magical item in their possession, but illegal items must be registered with a permit, and those items require a destination and a time for arrival. However, even when chandlers are ‘caught’ with illegal goods by an officiant wizard, they are still allowed to register a permit at that immediate moment, specifying their destination and time of arrival.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Healer Licensed</p>
			<p class="Body">Healers are a rare sort of wizard who use legal forms of pithology to mend organic material. Generally, healers heal people. But due to the nature of pithology spells, only non-permanent forms of organic conjuration and fusion spells are technically legal. This means that a healer could legally only give someone blood temporarily or put someone’s arm back on for a time. Permanent spells of an organic nature are highly illegal, so few wizards look to a healer’s license as a practical form of magic. Generally non-magical doctors are almost as effective as healers but require much less schooling. However, large hospitals and some militaries employ a few healers for the most dire and extreme cases. While permanent spells are obviously more practical, it is still quite practical to at least give someone blood for long enough until their body can recuperate, or reattach an arm in hopes that their body will mend it naturally by the time the spell wears off. </p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Mage Licensed</p>
			<p class="Body">Mages are the badasses of the wizarding world. Mages are generally commissioned by the military for combat training and magic capable of lethal force. Mages are required to pass more exams and are subject to more rigorous physical and psychological evaluations than any other professional in Braven. Mages must pass both entry and exit psychological evaluations (in addition to all other normal exams) before even being considered for mage licensure. (Mages are rarely licensed if any sign of psychosis, neurosis, or emotional instability show.) However, mages generally tend to see little action, despite their prestigious and incredibly hard schooling. Few nations actually employ their reserved mages in combat because of the difficulty, instability, and unpredictability of large-scale magical attacks. That being said, some companies do have a token mage who accompanies troops or serves as a personal advisor and guardian of a high-ranking official. On rare occasions, mercenary groups or other government offices will employ mages to serve due to their particular expertise and knowledge.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Naturalist Licensed</p>
			<p class="Body">A naturalist is a rare kind of wizard, but easily the most famous. Naturalists are among the most widely published and most accessible due to their work. Their work typically involves fieldwork out in nature, documenting monsters, creatures, magical phenomena, and uncharted lands. Naturalists sometimes travel in small groups with other wizards or in groups with guides, guards, or simply adventurers. Naturalists are the magical investigators of the wizarding world and every naturalist is required to do research for 7 years after receiving their license. Naturalists must do research every time they wish to have their license renewed. Many of the most well-known wizards were naturalists because most of the research that is publicly available has been written by a naturalist. Naturalists are only permitted to use civilian-level magic (only elementary magic and only in private) unless they are actively researching something. Of course, naturalists are generally allowed to use any non-illegal magic as long as they are not within the socio-public sphere. Pioneering, keen, and yet practical, naturalists are always Inspired for a new research opportunity. </p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Officiant Licensed</p>
			<p class="Body">Officiants are wizards who directly serve society through their knowledge of magic. The top two professions for a wizard officiant are inquisition specialists and advisors. Inquisition specialists are private detectives who work between the CIMP and local government to track apostate wizards and sorcery in order to enforce justice. Inquisitors, as they are called, generally investigate wizards who do not renew their licensing and follow up on reports of unlicensed or suspicious use of magic. Despite the fact that they are often the sole judiciary when incriminating apostates, sorcerers, and sorceresses, a Ranger, Master Templar, or highly specialized bounty hunter is generally commissioned to bring the lawbreaker in, on behalf of the CIMP and government. Inquisitors frequent trading hubs and are allowed to inspect the goods and practices of any wizard without warrant. Aside from inquisitors, officiants are often employed as advisors. Advisors work with nobles, government officials, the military, or the law as experts on magic and magic-related politics. Every member of the CIMP is an Officiant-licensed wizard-advisor. It should be noted that officiant wizards are not allowed use of magic in the public sphere unless it relates directly to the inspection, investigation, or enforcement of magic-related laws and regulations. In private, officiants are technically only allowed to use civilian-level magic. Officiants, whether inquisitors or advisors, always hold powerful office wherever they are serving.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Priest Licensed</p>
			<p class="Body">The priest is the most common kind of wizard, making up nearly one-third of all licensures. Typically a priest serves inside of a church, consecrating the magical elements and administering magic to the attendees. Some priests choose to stay inside the university and teach up and coming priests as a professor. The priest is considered the oldest role of wizard, according to the Holy Body. Long before any mention of the word ‘wizard’ are many references to priests and their miracles. Priests are licensed to practice many forms of body and mind manipulation spells as well as basic, legal forms of pithology. Priests are given a different book than other wizards with their licensure, called the Book of the Divine. Inside the Book of the Divine are numerous accounts and narratives of miraculous acts by famous prophets, leaders, and priests of the past. At the end of the book are a few essence-related spells, written in standard form for easy casting. Many priests are known to give up their practice of essence-magic in old age, after years of contemplating their holy scriptures. Some even try practicing the ancient art of ‘faith magic,’ which is primarily the magic recorded in the Book of the Divine. (It should be noted that while there are many different levels of priests within the Holy Body’s hierarchy, they all still reference this profession for their starting stats.)</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Scholar Licensed</p>
			<p class="Body">Scholars are wizards who wish to continue research related to magic after they have finished their schooling. All university wizards who teach as professors, except for priests, are scholars. Scholars are encouraged to study a specialized area of magic so that they will have more expertise when doing research or teaching novice wizards. Scholars, due to their work, have more privileged access to sensitive materials than any other license. Technically, when actively doing research within a university or in a non-socio-public sphere (outside of cities/towns or inside a home) a scholar is permitted to use or do almost anything in the name of progress. However, most scholars find that even this practice is heavily regulated because they are required to get Magical Permits for illegal use of magic, and the permits are highly specific, one-time use permits. If the nature of the permit is extreme enough, several scholars might be required under the direct supervision of an officiant wizard. Due to these cumbersome politics, many scholars either teach quietly in a college or disappear into obscurity in private life somewhere, perhaps renewing their license or not. Aside from magic-permits for universally illegal magic, scholars are permitted under their licensure to use almost all magic that other licensed wizards are permitted to use, with one exception: they must not use other licensed magic in public, only in private, on a college’s grounds, or completely outside of society.</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Unlicensed</p>
			<p class="Body">An unlicensed wizard might refer to any of the following: a wizard whose license was revoked, who failed to renew their license, practices magic outside of their license, practices illegal magic, or a non-wizard who practices magic that is either illegal or requires a license to do so. (See: Outlaw – Sorcerer)</p>
			<p class="Title">Personalities</p>
			<p class="Body">Quite shamelessly, “personalities” were developed as a fusion of several different personality tests that exist out there today (in the real world, that is). That being said, there are eight different personalities that a player can choose for their character. Their character’s personality says a lot about both how their character will progress as they level but also how the character might be expected to act. Personalities can change after character creation, but it isn’t easy (considered “Cognitive Dissonance” in Paradigm Shifts for Plot Points). However, after the character’s profession, nothing defines the character as much as their personality. And even with enough time (leveling, questing, fame, exposure, etc.) a character’s personality becomes just about the most important thing about them. New players, especially those who are unexposed to acting or pretending of any kind, are simply encouraged to choose their own (actual, real-life) personality and simply play their character as some kind of avatar of themselves.</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;6 Descriptors are as follows, with a brief description of each pair:</p>
			<p class="Body">Innovative (I) or Conventional (C): Innovative characters are highly impractical people who prefer to commit themselves and their energy towards possibilities such as a new idea, adventure, method, or creation. Innovative characters are impractical because they really might want to reinvent the wheel, if the wheel has an imagined potential yet unlocked. While innovative characters might appear to be completely impractical or foolish, they are not always impractical. For example: an innovative character who would rather take the risk of investing all of their time and energy into traveling to an unexplored land (which to accomplish requires an incredible amount of practical knowledge and execution) than simply letting the unknown continue to be a mystery. Conventional characters are practical; they know that often the best way is to follow a course that has already been perfected, rather than wasting time scavenging for alternatives. While conventional characters might seem to be lacking in creativity, they simply value practicality more (even though they may in fact be a very creative person). For example: a conventional character who loves the idea of retiring some day and practicing art but doesn’t want to starve before they ever get the chance. A steady job, careful planning, and perhaps they can afford the flexibility they need some day.</p>
			<p class="Body">Harmonious (H) or Resolute (R): Harmonious characters are those whose primary satisfaction and peace in life comes from a sense of pursuing harmony with the world around them. Harmonious characters are most troubled when their friends, family, and allies are troubled. Harmonious characters are adept at understanding the ways that sentient creatures interact with others and the world. Harmonious characters are interested in solving problems that are related to living things and the living world, such as: social, environmental, cultural, and behavioral problems, to name a few. Resolute characters are those whose satisfaction and peace in life comes from a sense of pursuing efficiency and logic (and primarily when those are accomplished completely). Resolute characters are most troubled when systems or entities function illogically and waste resources. Resolute characters are adept at reducing things to their smallest parts, in order to understand them better. Resolute characters are interested in solving problems that are related to the function (and sometimes the form) of things in the world, such as: engineering, financial, scientific, and industrial problems, to name a few. </p>
			<p class="Body">Spontaneous (S) or Deliberate (D): Spontaneous characters might make plans, but they are always willing to drop plans for better opportunities. While often cursed with a lack of integrity or commitment to a particular project or idea, they are quick to adopt and adapt to newness when presented. Deliberate characters don’t just make plans, they do everything they can to see those plans completed. Deliberate characters might occasionally miss opportunities or lack flexibility because they are committed to a greater goal, vision, or idea, but they are known for follow-through and completeness when they make promises.</p>
			<p class="Body">The eight personalities are as follows, with a brief description of each:</p>
			<p class="Body">IHS: IHSs are idealists. They are invested in abstract concepts of justice, harmony, and are incredible social-innovators. IHSs are characters that concern themselves with exploring ideas, helping others, and creating alternative ways of doing things and solving problems. IHSs are good at going with the flow, so to speak, and find it difficult to execute plans that are developed too far ahead of time. They prefer to remain available so that they can respond and react with more flexibility to problems or interruptions that can arise.</p>
			<p class="Body">IHD: IHDs are dreamers and thinkers who project themselves and others into the future. Known for their visionary capability, IHDs tend to be the ones who conjure up new paths for others to tread. IHDs are often concerned with abstract concepts like salvation, meaning, and being while practicing strategic forms of innovation. IHDs are strongly motivated by their love for others, and sometimes to a fault. IHDs use their wisdom and their charismatic nature to help and challenge those around them. Natural influencers and advisors, IHDs are always thinking deeply about the possibilities and potential they see in others.</p>
			<p class="Body">IRD: IRDs are utter, terrifying geniuses. Ruthless, logical, rational, and exacting, IRDs are those who invent ideas that others were often too afraid to. IRDs concern themselves with understanding and innovating complex systems of power and structures of control while formulating strategies for solving abstract and even cerebral issues with ease. IRDs are skilled at getting others to believe in their innovations, often gathering minions who are willing to do all the necessary things that must be done. Living for a sense of accomplishment and challenge, IRDs typically find themselves to be the best person to solve the hardest problems. IRDs are known for their incredible intellect, health, and presence among others.</p>
			<p class="Body">IRS: IRSs are crazy and often misunderstood people of brilliance. The most innovative and eccentric of all the personalities, IRSs are capable of coming up with wild and absurd ideas on the fly, thinking completely out of the box, and disregarding plans or expectations at a moment’s notice (if a better idea presents itself). Often divergent, IRSs prefer to avoid the complications that can arise out of blunt, straightforwardness. IRSs instead tend to find alternatives that no one thought existed or were even possible. IRSs, while cursed with an eternal inability to commit themselves to things in general, are often more fluid and flexible than anyone else when coming up with all kinds of pure crazy.</p>
			<p class="Body">CHD: CHDs are the reliable, sturdy, humble folk of the world, although sometimes noted for their stubbornness. The most common personality, but certainly not incapable of a sense of inner uniqueness, CHDs are always the most unthanked heroes and heroines of any story. CHDs often do work that most others don’t have the patience for, and are rarely given the credit they deserve. CHDs, while not known for their creative capabilities, are the best at following orders, executing plans, and for that reason are seen as trustworthy and reliable people. CHDs believe that by serving others with integrity, they show their devotion.</p>
			<p class="Body">CRD: CRDs are keen, sharp, and unwavering. Often seen as rigid, fierce, and stoic, CRDs are typically the most perceptive and investigative of all the personalities. While not necessarily innovative thinkers, they are incredibly intelligent, letting no stone go unturned and no piece left unconsidered. CRDs believe in a sense of order, control, and strictly adhere to rules for a sense of organization and understanding in the world. CRDs are the most capable at compartmentalizing information and handling complex pieces of data all at once. CRDs are motivated by a need to restore things from chaos, exact justice, and prepare for future disasters.</p>
			<p class="Body">CHS: CHSs are the captivators of the world. Known for having a dramatic and engaging personality, CHSs are always noticed when they are in social situations. CHSs, not known for their intelligence or wisdom, make up for this in their grace and influential behavior. CHSs live to be known and recognized and to experience what others have not (or lack the bravery to do). Seen often as the most daring, CHSs are capable of going places that others would not be willing, making them incredible trailblazers, free-spirits, and overall memorable characters.</p>
			<p class="Body">CRS: CRSs are among the most efficient and effective people, whatever they set their mind to do. While not necessarily brave, strong of will, or good with people, CRSs invest themselves instead into their own abilities. CRSs are the most talented and driven of all the personalities, seeking first and foremost to make themselves and their work of the most excellent quality. CRSs, while sometimes seen as self-serving, are often the most valuable assets to any team due to how invested they are in whatever they have chosen to specialize in. In fact, they are always seen by others as paramount specialists in something, that one person who is needed for the most difficult sort of job.</p>
			<p class="Body">&#9;For the specific bonuses that each personality receives, see the Host’s Guide.</p>
			<p class="Body">Method: Shortcut Character</p>
			<p class="Body">1.&#9;Try asking the player to tell their character’s story. Start by asking these questions:</p>
			<p class="Body">a.&#9;What sort of background does your character have?</p>
			<p class="Body">i.&#9;What ethnicity is your character? What sort of look do you want your character to have?</p>
			<p class="Body">ii.&#9;What nationality or culture, if any, does your character come from?</p>
			<p class="Body">iii.&#9;What profession, what work, is your character known for, if any? </p>
			<p class="Body">iv.&#9;How old is your character? (Age can easily build possible work-history.)</p>
			<p class="Body">b.&#9;What sort of personality will your character have? (Or ask what sort of personality the player has, if they aren’t sure of their character’s personality yet.)</p>
			<p class="Body">c.&#9;What sort of strange, unique or quirky things might make your character special?</p>
			<p class="Body">d.&#9;What sort of character do you want to become? Will you have specific goals? Is there anything in your character’s background or story that might point to where they wish to go or what they might want to do?</p>
			<p class="Body">e.&#9;Note: Most of the time players actually choose their character’s name at the end of the character creation process, so don’t spend too much time waiting for them to find a name.</p>
			<p class="Body">2.&#9;The answers to these questions can put character creation into narrative terms, instead of mathematical or numerical terms. Knowing what feel a player wants over what sort of numbers make them most efficient (as a fighter, mage, etc) actually makes the character creation process easier and more enjoyable. Players also tend to be much more satisfied with a character created in this way.</p>
			<p class="Body">3.&#9;The character creation process moves very smoothly when done in the following order:</p>
			<p class="Body">a.&#9;Begin. At this time, have the player roll for their character’s stats and you and the player approach brainstorming about their character in a narrative sense. (Ask the questions from earlier.)</p>
			<p class="Body">b.&#9;Find the character’s ethnicity. In my experience most players will make one of two types of choices when determining the ethnicity of their character, whichever ethnicity can optimize their stats and whichever ethnicity simply seems the most appealing to them at the time. It is strongly encouraged to emphasize to the player the second kind of character-building choices. Making a character that feels good is actually easier to accomplish than a character that feels strong or powerful. This style of character building puts the player’s character in light of uniqueness, specialness, and fun. This often gives players a much more moving sense of attachment and ownership to their character than a perspective simply of optimized strengths. It also should be noted that it is incredibly hard to build a powerful force of a character at the beginning anyway, and it is relatively much easier to do so as the game progresses. After the character’s ethnicity has been found, record their ethnicity at the top of the character sheet next to Ethnicity. Then add and calculate all bonuses to the character based on ethnicity.</p>
			<p class="Body">i.&#9;First add the information from the section Ethnicity-Related Bonuses to Stats and Vitality to the player’s character sheet. These bonuses are added to the columns labeled Bonus under STATS and VITALITY on the character sheet. Health bonuses are simply added to the row HEALTH.</p>
			<p class="Body">ii.&#9;Second add the information from the section Ethnic Advantages and Disadvantages to the player’s character sheet. These bonuses are added as passive shape bonuses and can be recorded in any one of the three red columns at the bottom of the character sheet. If any bonuses apply directly to Arts, these may be written in that art’s row. Additional shape points awarded at this time may be recorded at SHAPE under the VITALITY section, to be spent later during character creation.</p>
			<p class="Body">c.&#9;Find the character’s Culture/Nationality. This will simply allow certain professions to be chosen by the player, as well as give a possible perspective for building narrative and backstory. Record their culture at the top of the character sheet next to Culture/Nationality/Other.</p>
			<p class="Body">d.&#9;Find the character’s Profession. As noted before, the narrative intention of the player should be understood before the player chooses their character’s profession. Due to the large quantity of possible professions that a player may choose from, it is not recommended that time be spent choosing a profession that optimizes their character. And because I know personally that many players do simply want to create a character who is the most destructive soldier or the best spell caster, then the obvious profession options should be made known to them. The reasons for this are mostly due to time constraints. Often when creating many characters, the host’s job is to ask enough questions to the player and come to an understanding narratively, and then prescribe a recommended few options. I have found this works best. When the player has chosen their character’s profession, record this next to Profession at the top of the character sheet.</p>
			<p class="Body">e.&#9;Find the character’s Personality. If the player isn’t sure how to differentiate their personality from their character’s, then simply recommend a personality that matches the player. But many players I have found are either unhappy with their own personality’s benefits or they would simply prefer to try a new kind of character. Ask them sample questions from the Personality: Who is your character? Section. When their character’s personality has been found, record this next to Personality on the character sheet. Note later when the character is leveled up that any and all benefits for the character based on their personality go in the Level columns of the STATS and VITALITY sections. Note that only benefits from the character’s personality go in the Level column. All other benefits go under the Bonus column, including shape, ethnicity, profession, or item-related benefits.</p>
			<p class="Body">f.&#9;Level up. Level the character up based on their Profession (if necessary) or calculate for level 1. After the player has chosen their character’s ethnicity, culture, profession, and personality then their character may be leveled up. At this time some professions will place the character at a higher level than others, but require certain practice points be distributed in certain ways. Keep track of these things as you are leveling starting characters. It also should be noted that many benefits are available to players for narrative purposes, which may or may not be practical ones. Some characters may have a home or children, a community which knows them well, while others may not. It is at this time that the history of the character is important in the leveling up process.</p>
			<p class="Body">g.&#9;Spend Shape Points. After a character has reached the level that they will start playing at, their shape points may be spent. Many shape options are only available to the character at the beginning of the game, so keep track of these. Some characters may have much more shape points than others, depending on their ethnicity, profession, and personality. Also to note, shape points that are gained specifically from leveling up (due to their profession) may not be spent on starting shape options if the host decides that this is fair. The points earned from ethnicity, profession, and disadvantages may be the only shape points that are be spent on beginning-only shape options. The points spent from these categories may be spent on benefits that are not starting-only restricted, however. Then after starting-only shape options are chosen, the player may choose to save or to spend the remainder of their shape points on the at-any-time shape options. Shape options and their benefits must be recorded on the character sheet. The shape options must be written at the bottom of the character sheet or on the back, and the benefits must be recorded in the correct columns and categories where they belong. IE, If the shape option “Stat Boost” is chosen twice, once for Prowess and once for Wits, it must be recorded as “Stat Boost I – Prowess” and “Stat Boost II – Wits” on the bottom or the back of the character sheet. The +2 for each must be recorded in their respective Bonus columns in the STATS category on the character sheet.</p>
			<p class="Body">h.&#9;Spend Gift Points. After shape points have been distributed, (and some may have been chosen to convert into gift points) the character’s gift points may be spent. Make sure that players have carefully examined the rules and requisites for gifts so that by this time they have a pretty good idea which gifts they will be choosing to start with. Often because of the vast depth of options for gifts, it can become both time consuming and overly-rushed for different players to choose their gifts. It is quite helpful to have a player’s handbook for at least each player, so that during downtime in the character creation process they can be browsing possible gift exploration options both at the start and in the future for their character. Gifts that are chosen must be recorded at the bottom of the character sheet in the red columns or on the back of the character sheet. Any benefits to arts given by gifts must be recorded in the Bonus column under the ARTS section.</p>
			<p class="Body">i.&#9;Total everything. At this time make sure that every stat, art, and vitality is totaled, that weight , encumbrance, and move are accounted for, and the player (if they choose to do so) has filled out their character’s combat-reference sheet. Make sure to record unspent gift points and shape points, and if the host decides to award one starting plot point, they may do so at this time.</p>
			<p class="Body">j.&#9;Calculate Potential and Initiative. The character’s potential may either be half of their lowest stat or one third of their highest stat. (I personally only allow the former of those two options, but both are sufficient for balance purposes.) The character’s initiative is their lowest stat. Record these under the category STATS, next to their respective initials (PT and INI).</p>
			<p class="Body">k.&#9;Items. Purchase and make any starting items the character will have using money that the character has. However, many freedoms may not be available to the character at this time depending on how the host wishes to build the narrative of the character. Some characters, for example have much more money than others and it is the host’s discretion to restrict their purchases before the start of play. Additionally, it might be important in the narrative that the character actually starts with very few possessions to their name. Alternatively, the host may just choose to allow the player to purchase any item they desire for their character at this time. After all characters have purchased items and properly recorded them in the blue section on the right-hand side of the character sheet, the character creation process closes and the game begins. </p>
			<p class="Body">Leveling Up: Leveling Up is rather organic. The different rewards given are as follows, and each of these are given at different intervals: Practice Points, Status, Gift Points, and Stats. The player applies their bonuses for leveling once they successfully sleep, waking up a more powerful character.</p>
			<p class="Body">Practice Points: Practice Points are gained every 3rd level (starting at Level 1, then 3, 6, 9, etc.). The character receives extra Practice Points to distribute at will.  They receive 10 practice points. The information to the right below is a conversion rate of how many Practice Points equal 5 Art Skill, based on the desired skill the character is trying to reach. (For example, when the character has 5 skill and wishes to reach 10 skill, the cost is only one practice point. But when the player wishes to raise their skill from 10 to 15, it would cost them 2 practice points.)</p>

			<p class="Body">Prime Stat Specializations (In addition, a +5 is given to the stat and shape purchases have max roll)</p>
			<p class="Body">Physique: Character gains +1 to Move and may choose to max and double all their dice rolled for damage once per day (melee attacks only, applies to abilities as well as base weapon damage). This multiplier stacks with Critical Effects.</p>
			<p class="Body">Wellness: All Health and Stamina heals received, from regen, spells, or abilities are twice as effective.</p>
			<p class="Body">Grace: Character may roll again once per day for any maneuver of choice and choose the highest of the two rolls.</p>
			<p class="Body">Prowess: One tenth of Prowess is added to Initiative, up to a max of +10. In addition, the character has a permanent +1 to Potential.</p>
			<p class="Body">Erudition: Character receives an additional 2 Practice Points when Practice Points are distributed (every third level). In addition, Shape Purchases which give a bonus to Lore Arts do not increase subsequent purchase costs.</p>
			<p class="Body">Wits: Character may choose one Art that permanently uses Wits instead of its base stat.</p>
			<p class="Body">Prestige: Shape Purchases invested into Charisma or Authority grant twice the amount. Also, the character begins with +5 International Reputation with the Disposition Type of their choice.</p>
			<p class="Body">Nerve: Sanity Regen uses a +d6 instead of +d3 each day. In addition, every Bonus (not Level or Roll values) added to the character’s Nerve also adds to their Spell Resist as a Bonus.</p>
			<p class="Title">Shape</p>
			<p class="Body">Shape is a concept that governs the uniqueness and customizability of a character. Shape points are a currency that are spent by a player (primarily at character creation, although also in smaller amounts as a character levels) in order to purchase unique abilities, extra skill in arts, or special bonuses for their character. Some shape options may only be chosen at character creation, in order to explain a character’s background (and how exactly they have a +15 sword made of silver or are really attuned to nature, for example). Among the options that can only be chosen at character creation are disadvantages. Disadvantages grant extra shape points for spending, in exchange for permanent disabilities for the character (such as fat fingers, or poor navigation skills). The shape options that may be purchased at any time are labelled as such.</p>
			<p class="Title">Starting Disadvantages</p>
			<p class="Body">These traits are what every level one character has, unless specified otherwise. The Shape Points cost to have these disadvantages removed are recorded below in the subsection Starting Advantages.</p>

			<p class="Title">Starting Advantages</p>

If a trait combines the advantages from other traits and explicitly says so, those other traits may not be purchased.

			<p class="Sub-Header">(Requires Host’s Approval)</p>
			<p class="Body">You have one Wizard license, starting with 5 runes from Class 1 of your License. These are stored on pages in your Wizard’s Enchiridion. This Enchiridion tracks and records any time it is used to cast a spell and may alert authorities if used by someone other than yourself. You also gain a Pin, according to your license which you are required by law to display at all times. At level 5 you gain 5 more runes if you visit a Licence Office and you’ve book has been analyzed for any illegal use. You gain all your Class 2 runes at level 10, all your Class 3 at level 20, and all your Class 4 at level 30. These all must be approved at a Licensing Office. The Wizard Licenses are: Alchemist, Healer, Mage, Officiant, Naturalist, Priest, Scholar, and Chandler.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Sorcerer(ess)</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">(Requires Host’s Approval)</p>
			<p class="Body">You have access to magic illegally. You never gain new runes, but can choose your runes at the start. You keep them in a book of notes.

You may choose any 5 runes, but only 2 may be Class 1 Illegal or only 1 may be Class 2 Illegal.</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Indigenous Practitioner Permit</p>

			<p class="Title">Regular Advantages</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">(May only choose during character creation)</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Friends</p>
			<p class="Body">Companion – Minion &#9;-6 Shape</p>
			<p class="Body">This trait allows the character to have a minion. If the minion is a humanoid, it is considered a slave of the character and must have the stats of a Fodder Minion. If the minion is not a humanoid, then the character may choose between a horse, narc-gulling, or other relatively useful minion. The minion cannot be too intelligent, powerful, or have too much utility unless the GH decides the player could purchase these traits for more Shape points. For example, a Koda bear is a rideable, powerful, intelligent beast that can both understand communication from the character and also communicate back. The player may choose the relationship of their character to their minion; friendship or master-slave. A friendship increases the minion’s and the character’s SN regeneration by 1 each day. If either character dies for any reason, this SN bonus is lost and the living character loses [d10+10SN] along with any other negatives for losing a friend.</p>
			<p class="Body">Companion – Pet&#9;-3 Shape</p>
			<p class="Body">This trait allows the character to have a pet. This pet may be of a variety of small creature ethnicities, from peetle-bug to a dog.

A pet and its owner have empathy with each other and having a pet heals the character for 1 extra SN every day. If the pet dies for any reason, this bonus is lost along with [d10+5SN].</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Items</p>
			<p class="Body">Heirloom – Armor &#9;-4 Shape</p>
			<p class="Body">This trait allows the character to receive a piece of armor from their backstory to start with. The armor stats are determined by a treasure roll with a random level of richness, quality, and material. The specific piece of armor may be made clear by the character’s player. A helmet, a shield, an arm-guard and a leg-guard are examples of what may be chosen with this. A breastplate or other piece of chest armor costs an additional Shape point.</p>
			<p class="Body">Heirloom – Item &#9;-2 Shape</p>
			<p class="Body">This trait allows the character to receive an item from their backstory to start with. The item stats are determined by a treasure roll with a random level of richness, quality, and material. The specific type of item may be made clear by the character’s player.

			<p class="Body">Heirloom – Weapon&#9;-3 Shape</p>
			<p class="Body">This trait allows the character to receive a weapon from their backstory to start with.

If a rune does not cost PT (but is channeled or takes time) its Shape Point cost is equal to the Sanity Cost of the rune. There is no speed increase in memorizing a rune like this, but its SN cost is halved. A memorized rune is cast stealthily, since there is no exterior display of its casting (this does not apply to glyphs used with the rune).</p>
