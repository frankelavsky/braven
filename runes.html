			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The following section is dedicated to runes, which are sources of magical power. Runes are written symbols which when read will cast a spell. Before a rune is read (and cast as a spell), the caster may use glyphs in order to give commands to their spell. The process for using magic involves two parts: creating a spell and then casting that spell. Each have their own characteristics.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">How to Create a Spell:</span></p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">A spell is comprised of two parts: glyphs and runes. These are explained briefly below:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Glyphs</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">Glyphs are commands that a caster can give to a spell. If the caster does not give a spell any commands, then the spell will cast onto the caster (with no special enhancements) by default. Some glyphs examples are:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Direct:</span> This glyph allows the caster to target things other than themselves. The default range of this glyph is one unit. </p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Range:</span> This glyph increases the distance that a rune can travel. If used without Direct, the rune will randomly strike a target within range.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Duration: </span>This glyph makes a spell last longer, dealing its effects again each round or increasing its effectiveness.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Runes</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">Runes are the actual content of the spell. So while Direct and Range means that the caster is preparing to hit a target that is far away, the rune the caster chooses will affect what happens to their target. Two examples are given below:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Conjure Fire: </span>This rune will deal fire damage to whatever it is cast upon.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Recall: </span>This rune will allow the caster to see the memories of whatever it is cast upon.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Glyphs + a Rune = A Spell</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body _idGenParaOverride-1">So in our above examples, if the caster simply reads the rune for <span class="Italic">Conjure Fire</span>, they themselves would immolate. But if they prepared and used the glyphs <span class="Italic">Direct</span> and <span class="Italic">Range</span>, then they would be able to cast the fire on a specific target (of their choosing) far away from themselves. </p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">How to Cast a Spell:</span></p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">After a spell has been created (using glyphs or not) it can be cast upon a target in several different ways:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Portaling</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The default way to cast a spell is to create a portal from the essence realm that brings the spell into existence. The caster’s target becomes the catalyst for the portal, which means that they are the source of the spell itself. The spell instantly manifests onto its catalyst. This method of casting is considered default and any spell can be portaled.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-7"><span class="Italic">Example with Conjure Fire + Direct + Range: </span></p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The caster’s target suddenly bursts into flames as the caster brings their spell into reality. The caster’s target cannot defend against this.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Flinging</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">An alternative way to cast a spell is for the caster to use themselves as a catalyst for a spell, portaling it into reality through themselves. Once the spell has manifested, they can punch or throw their spell onto their target. Not all spells can be flung, however. (Social spells cannot by default, in addition to some others that explicitly say so.)</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-7"><span class="Italic">Example with Conjure Fire + Direct + Range: </span></p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The caster’s hand glows with a ball of fire, which they throw through the air at their target. The caster’s target can chose to defend against this with a Dodge, Block, or Deflect.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Whispering</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The last way to cast a spell is by whispering. Only social spells may be whispered. Similar to flinging, the caster uses themselves as a catalyst to portal the spell into reality. But once the spell has manifested, they whisper it (speak it) towards their target. Anyone can hear the spell being cast, but it will only affect the caster’s target.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-7"><span class="Italic">Example with Recall + Direct + Range: </span></p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The tip of the caster’s tongue tingles with magic and then they utter strange words. Their target hears these words and can try to defend with Willpower or Courage.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">A note on Counter-spell</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">Counter-spell works when a spell is <span class="Italic">created</span> (it must be used before a spell is flung or whispered).</p>

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading ParaOverride-7">Legal Runes: </p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Licensure and Free-Use</p>
			<p class="Body">This first section is a reference for all runes which are considered legal to use, but have licensing restrictions. For the most part, all of the runes in this following section require that their caster has a Wizard License, Templar Badge, or Paladin Badge. These licenses and badges are used to give the caster access to the runebooks that contain these spells. </p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">In order to use any rune (license-required, free-use, or illegal), the caster must have access to the written rune itself. All runes are recorded in some form or another and are always cast by reading them. </p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">In order to determine which license is needed for each spell, refer to the individual license-books (the specific runebooks). </p>
			<p class="Body">Despite these restrictions, there are two runes which can be used freely by anyone: Charm/Enthrall and General/Detailed Appraisal. These are easily found in several different household and tradebook publications. Anyone is allowed to cast these without fear of punishment.</p>

			<p class="Title">Bind/Loose Essence </p>
			<p class="Costs">Bind Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5Min/5SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster binds their essence to a target non-sentient object for 1 month. Caster may have their essence bound to one object (other than their own body) at a time, unless their soul is removed or split. </p>
			<p class="Body">When the caster binds their essence, they receive +20 and may be refunded up to 3SN for casting any spells on or through the object. Note: a caster cannot bind their essence to an object which already has a bound essence. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Loose Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[24Hours/45SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target essence may be set loose from whatever it is bound to (its “root”) for 1 hour. After this duration, the essence returns to its root. This rune can only be portaled, it cannot be whispered or flung. If the target essence is a source-essence (a soul), this rune must pass a spell DC for both the entity’s Lore type and Essence Lore. Otherwise, just an Essence Lore DC is required.</p>
			<p class="Body">Essence that is set loose will linger near its root unless it is moved or manipulated in some way further. During this time, any benefits or mechanics that the bound essence normally affords its root are rendered useless. The essence will still remain tethered to both its source and root, however. </p>
			<p class="Body">The unbound essence may be moved (see Hold/Move Essence) or split (see Join/Split Essence)and then bound to something else (with Bind Essence). In order to rebind essence (that belongs to a different caster), the caster of this rune must exceed the spell’s total casting value from when the Bind Essence was previous cast. </p>
			<p class="Body">If Loose Essence is used on a source-essence, the entity will become a husk during the time it spends without its soul. </p>

			<p class="Costs">Brighten</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1PT/1SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster conjures a light-source on a target object which lasts for one hour. The brightness is equivalent to sunlight (regular brightness). </p>

			<p class="Costs">Darken</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/4SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster may either dispel a magical light source or choose to darken an area. If the latter is chosen, Caster conjures a dark-source on a target object which lasts for 1 hour. </p>
			<p class="Body">The darkness conjured is equivalent to dim light with a radius of 30 units. However, in very bright light the darkness has a radius of 15 units and is perceived as shade/twilight darkness. If this is used from within dim or pitch black darkness, the radius will become immune to light (magical or not). </p>
			<p class="Body">Radius glyph adds ten units of radius per charge.</p>
			<p class="Title">Calm/Berserk (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Calm</p>
			<p class="Costs">[12PT/8SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster uses Comfort on a target to help them relax. </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell attempts to give one of two effects to the target (the caster must choose): the target gains +50 to Meditation/Rest for their next maneuver or the target begins to fall asleep immediately. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the latter is chosen, the target may add their Awareness Total to their resistance in an attempt to fend off the sleepiness. Using Magnify with this spell will halve the target’s Awareness bonus. If the target fails to resist, they fall prone into slumber for 1 round.  Each time the caster uses this on the same target, their ability to resist it increases +100% from their base resistance.</p>

			<p class="Costs">Charm</p>
			<p class="Costs">[9PT/12SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster’s target within range becomes charmed by another target of the caster’s choosing (within sight) and will not defend against their next attack. The target heals Sanity equal to half of any Health Damage received on the attack they cannot defend against. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Enthrall</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/15SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster’s target within range becomes enthralled by another target of the caster’s choosing (within sight) for one round. </p>
			<p class="Body">The target that is enthralled treats whatever or whoever they are enthralled by as a precious ally. The target takes Sanity Damage equal to any Health Damage they deal to the target that enthralls them. This may be used out of turn.</p>

			<p class="Costs">[5PT/1SN] </p>

			<p class="Title">Conjure/Dispel Disease </p>
			<p class="Costs">Conjure Disease</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/5SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster conjures a disease onto the target which immediately takes effect. This rune can be portaled, flung, or whispered. Disease conjured lasts for 1 day. </p>
			<p class="Body">This rune requires reagents for specific diseases to be conjured. If no reagents or improper reagents are used, then a Common Cold is conjured. The reagents required for conjuring a disease are found in The Book of Particulars.</p>

			<p class="Body">If the target succeeds in resisting, the disease stops advancing for one day. If the disease has already been stopped from advancing and the target resists, then the disease is removed.

			<p class="Costs">[4PT/2SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">SK/4 (8H + 3d20 + 80S) Conjures a blast of electricity onto, towards, or from the target. If target is metallic or immersed in water, damage is (8H + 3d20 + 160S) instead.</p>

This does not affect living essence (such as someone’s soul or bound essence) or spells as they are cast. The caster must exceed the Essence Lore DC of the essence being dispelled, which may be determined by the original caster’s spell-cast total.</p>

			<p class="Costs">Conjure Flora</p>
			<p class="Costs">[9PT/2SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster conjures a plant at a target location for five minues. If the caster has their essence bound to a certain type of flora, they may conjure that flora type without any difficulty. If the caster wishes to conjure any flora otherwise, they must roll Nature Lore to do so. </p>
			<p class="Body">The amount conjured is considered equivalent one cubic unit in total volume (but does not have to be restrained to one unit). For each additional cubic unit conjured, the caster must increase difficulty of the spell by 10 and spend 2 more SN.</p>

			<p class="Costs">Conjure Illusion</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/9SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster deceives a target and they experience a hallucination on one of their senses. They are distracted as long as the illusion remains and gain a negative to all maneuvers. If the spell succeeds, the illusion’s strength is calculated by subtracting the caster’s Charisma or Authority from the target’s Awareness (no rolling or defense bonuses applied). The resulting number becomes a negative that applies to all target’s actions. If Magnified, two senses are affected and target only uses half of their Awareness total instead. This rune costs 9SN and is channeled for one round. </p>

			<p class="Costs">Dispel Material</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Varies/Varies]</p>
			<p class="Body">A non-sentient, inorganic material may be dispelled for one round. During this time, it ceases to exist. At the end of the duration, it appears at the location where it was when it was dispelled. </p>
			<p class="Body">The PT cost of this rune is based on the size of the material. If the target is an item, it follows this conversion: tiny = 2PT, small = 3PT, medium = 4PT, large = 5PT, and huge = 6PT. If the target is not technically an item, then up to one cubic unit worth of the material may be dispelled for 9PT. The SN cost of this rune is equal to one tenth of the material’s DUR.</p>
			<p class="Title">Conjure/Dispel Poison </p>
			<p class="Costs">Conjure Poison</p>
			<p class="Costs">[9PT/1SN] </p>

			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[30Sec/10SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to dispel one poison or venom from target. Caster adds their Lore to the target’s Toughness to attempt to resist the poison or venom. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the target succeeds in resisting, the poison or venom stops advancing for five minutes. If the poison or venom has already been stopped from advancing and the target resists, then it is removed. (Typically, casting this twice is how a poison or venom is cured: first stopping progression, then the removal.)</p>
			<p class="Title">Conjure/Dispel Seeming (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Conjure Seeming</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/2SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster creates a visual disguise-illusion of their choosing that emanates from their target. The size-type and general shape-type of the target cannot be visually affected, but the color, texture, and general content otherwise can change. </p>
			<p class="Body">For example, a medium humanoid can appear to look like another sort of medium humanoid. The target may gain (or lose) up to +2d6 to any social actions taken, depending on their new appearance. </p>

			<p class="Body">If used with Weaken: One material-unit of water is conjured permanently (this is equivalent to one day’s worth of water rations). </p>
			<p class="Body">Optionally, three cubic units of water may be conjured from target location for one round instead. Caster may choose the shape or direction of the three cubic units, but they must be adjacent to at least one other unit of conjured water. This water cannot be consumed for hydration, because it ceases to exist after one minute. This water performs like normal water would, so it is capable of disrupting footing. </p>
			<p class="Body">If an entity’s standing space is occupied entirely by water (an average person requires one unit, a horse might require two or three), they must roll a Balance DC against the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total or fall prone and take a KN/3 attack that deals standard falling damage: [3d20+(Target WE)] as Stamina Damage.</p>

			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[7PT/21SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">One cubic unit of water may be dispelled from target location for one round. If this is used on an entity, it becomes severely dehydrated and takes [2d20+5 Health Damage] to Death Health in addition to the caster’s [Lore Total x10] as Stamina Damage. This cannot deal trauma and is not mitigated by armor.</p>

			<p class="Costs">Counter Spell</p>
			<p class="Costs">[2PT/1SN per Stack] </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell increases the difficulty of another spell being cast. May be used defensively. Counter Spell must be used as a rune manifests (the moment it is whispered, flung, or portaled). Direct and Range may be required to counter a spell, based on where the portal’s location is (not necessarily the caster).</p>
			<p class="Body">For every 2PT and 1SN the caster may add 2d20 against their opponent’s spell modifier. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Empower Spell</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[2PT/3SN per Stack]</p>
			<p class="Body">2d20 is added to the target’s spell casting maneuver per 2PT and 3SN spent. Unlike Counter Spell, Empower Spell is actually cast on the caster, not the spell’s portal location (Direct and Range may still be required). This may also be used out of turn.</p>
			<p class="Title">Daunt/Hearten (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Daunt</p>
			<p class="Costs">[4PT/8SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster uses Intimidate to interrupt their target and force them to either flee or take 1d6 Stun (the target gets to choose).

			<p class="Costs">Empower Sycophancy</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1PT/8SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster attempts to influence the reputation a target has over a local area. This spell may only be active on one target at a time, per caster. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster rolls 2d6 and adds this bonus to the target’s recognition by the locale while affecting their disposition as well (the caster may choose one disposition to affect). This spell takes two weeks to take effect and lasts permanently. Any person who spends two weeks or more in the locale after the spell has been cast falls under the spell. The spell loses its effect once a person has spent equal time out of the locale as they have spent under the spell. </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster may choose: Hated, Despised, Feared, or Beloved dispositions. (For more information on Dispositions, see the Reputations and Dispositions guide.) </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell inherently has a “range” that affects a Local-sized populace. Radius increases this size to Region, while three stacks of Radius increase this size to National. </p>
			<p class="Body">Duration I and II decreases the time it takes for the spell to have an effect by 1 day per stack, and Duration III reduces the wait time by 2 days per stack. Magnify will double the base 2d6 and the effectiveness of Duration stacks used. Mundane Permanence allows the caster to have multiple targets/locales/dispositions at a time, but still only one use of Sycophancy per target per locale. If the caster uses Arcane Permanence, they may stack effects on a single target in a single locale (see Permanent Glyph for the risks involved with Arcane).</p>
			<p class="Costs">Disrupt Sycophancy</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>

			<p class="Body">The caster makes the target immune to Sycophancy effects for one hour. However, if the caster’s target is the target of a Sycophancy spell, then the Sycophancy’s details (but not area of effect) may be changed: the disposition type may be re-chosen by the caster or removed or the bonuses of the original Sycophancy may be rerolled.</p>
			<p class="Title">Enable/Disable Mystical Deposit </p>
			<p class="Costs">[Varies/2SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster takes a non-sentient object and deposits it into a mystical storage.</p>
			<p class="Body">Access to the mystical storage must be opened before this rune may be cast. (See Open Mystical Storage.) Note: the object being used as an access opening cannot be deposited within its own portal.</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster must be touching the portal or the item they wish to deposit when casting this spell. If the target is touching the item they wish to deposit, they must target the Mystical Storage portal (using Direct or Range). If the caster is touching the portal, they must target the item they wish to deposit (using Direct or Range). If this spell is flung and not portaled, the item will actually travel physically from its location into the Storage portal. Otherwise (if portaled), the item will simply disappear and become stored instantly.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the storage cannot hold the WE of the item being deposited, then the spell’s casting is wasted. The item will simply collide with the object being used as a portal as if the portal simply weren’t there. </p>
			<p class="Body">The PT required to cast this rune is equal to the PT of the item being stored. If an item does not have a PT cost, then the size of the item correlates to its PT cost. Tiny, small, medium, large, and huge items cost 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 PT, respectively. Items larger than huge may have their PT determined by the host, if not specified otherwise (generally one cubic unit worth of material requires 9PT for interaction).</p>

			<p class="Body">Access to the Mystical Storage must be opened before this rune may be cast. (See Open Mystical Storage.) In addition, the caster must have knowledge of the Mystical Storage’s contents (either they have kept a personal ledger, or used the spell Understand).</p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster is touching the portal itself, they do not need to use Direct or Range glyphs to withdraw an item from the Mystical Storage. If the caster is not touching the portal, they must target the portal using Direct or Range glyphs. If this spell is flung and not portaled, the item will actually travel physically from its the Storage portal into the caster’s hand. Otherwise (if portaled), the item will simply appear in the caster’s grasp instantly.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster incorrectly attempts to withdraw an item that is not contained within the storage, this rune’s resources are wasted.</p>
			<p class="Body">The PT required to cast this rune is equal to the PT of the item being stored. If an item does not have a potential, then the size of the item correlates to its PT cost.

(For example if a 10 is rolled here, then the target may fail on any roll up to a natural 15.) If a fumble or auto-fail is not possible, then any roll within the range calculates as a natural 1. If the roll is open ended, any roll within the range activates a negative roll, but only for the first roll. This may be used out of turn.</p>

			<p class="Body">The caster learns the full value of one target item. The caster learns whether or not the item contains magic, what physical or natural modifications have been made to the item, and the crafter or creator of the item. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster learns what magic the item contains in value and function only (for example, that the item can shoot balls of flame once per day that deal so and so damage, but not that the item has a Conjure: Fire rune with Magnify I, Direct II, Range II, Impact II with three charges, etc). </p>
			<p class="Body">In order to know the spell that was constructed as well, the caster must use another rune (Understand).</p>
			<p class="Title">Gravity/Anti-gravity </p>
			<p class="Costs">Gravity</p>
			<p class="Costs">[7PT/18SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Target gains a significant boost to their personal gravitational field. Caster’s Alchemy Lore Total is added as WE to their target for one round. Target also becomes immune to knockback but getting up from knockdown costs double. </p>
			<p class="Body">Using Radius with this rune does not increase the mass of all targets in the radius (as it does to its primary target) but rather creates a field of gravity that centers on the target (extending the pull of the target’s gravitational field). The target’s gravity field also makes them easier to hit, granting all attacks (except portaled spells) a bonus equal to one tenth of the caster’s Alchemy Lore to hit, per unit of gravitational field added to the radius. For example, if 4u of radius were added, all attacks would gain a bonus of [+40% of caster’s Alchemy Lore Total] to hit. Note that using Magnify increases the radius only, it does not add an additional 10% per unit. </p>
			<p class="Body">Using Impact with this rune also has a unique effect: instead of adding a single, damaging force to the attack, an attack is made per stack of Impact added. Each attack is a small object that got caught in the gravitational field, be it a pebble, shard of metal, or dinnerware. Each object deals Impact’s single-stack damage per attack. The type is typically a 50-50 mix of PU or SM type attacks (replacing Impact’s BL type), but different types may be chosen by the host given the environment around the target. These attacks can gain a bonus to hit based on Radius and will always gain the maximum amount offered by Radius.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Anti-Gravity</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[6PT/30SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster removes WE from their target equal to the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total, decreasing the target’s reaction to gravity. This bonus applies to the target’s entire body, not just the limb targeted. Optionally, the caster may choose to reduce the WE of their target by any value up to this total (rather than this full amount). This rune lasts for one round and may be used defensively.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the total WE removed exceeds the total WE of the target, it levitates. The target will require some form of lateral propulsion to move. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the total WE removed is 50% or more of the target’s WE and the target is an entity, they may jump twice as high or twice as far. If an object, it has double range when thrown, fired, or otherwise propelled. </p>
			<p class="Body">If Radius is used with this rune, the target is no longer affected by reduced WE, but instead is surrounded by an anti-gravity field which will follow them. This field will affect the first attack that enters or exits the radius. Using Duration increases the number of attacks affected per stack (but Duration I and II will decrease the effectiveness by 50%).</p>
			<p class="Body">If the first attack enters the radius, it will have its attack maneuver reduced by the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the anti-gravity field alone reduces the attack’s modifier below zero, the attack is reflected back at the attacker with an attack value equal to the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total. This attack targets the center of the body but it rolls on the Glance Table (for placement only, it still deals full damage). If Impact was used with this rune, it will be added to any attack that gets reflected.</p>
			<p class="Body">However, if the first attack begins inside the gravity field and ends outside of it, it is greatly accelerated and adds the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total to Stamina Damage done. If Impact was used, it will increase the first attack’s damage by Impact’s total amount as well. </p>

			<p class="Costs">Slow</p>

			<p class="Title">Hinder/Hide Perceptibility </p>
			<p class="Costs">Hinder Perceptibility</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/6SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster chooses one sense to completely hinder on their target. This may be used defensively. Target is rendered blind, deaf, without taste, without smell, or numb. This may be used defensively, but only to numb. Otherwise, this is considered a parimary action.</p>
			<p class="Body">If blind: target has vision equal to being in Dim brightness. Deafness, without taste, and without smell should be self-explanatory. If target is numbed, they receive +0/25% to mitigation. This cannot increase Stamina MIT by more than 90%. This spell is channeled and costs 6SN per round. Note: using Magnify with this rune adds another sense, but it will not double the effects on a single sense. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Hide Perceptibility</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[12PT/18SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster removes all sensory output from the target for 1 Round. The caster’s Lore is added to any DC made to notice the target (effectively adding Lore to Stealth, for entities). The target becomes shade-like in appearance, makes almost no sound, produces little smell or taste, and is difficult to notice the feel of. Because of the last effect, the target deals 50% damage with all non-magical attacks.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster chooses, they may wish to remove specific sensory output (instead of all at once), for example: just removing the taste of a piece of food, but it still remains the same otherwise. </p>
			<p class="Title">Hold/Move Essence </p>
			<p class="Costs">Hold Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/4SN] </p>

			<p class="Costs">Move Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[1Hour/15SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">This spell moves a target soul-essence (unbound only, see: Bind/Loose Essence), environmentally animated essence, or non-spell essence from one container or place to a target container or place.  </p>
			<p class="Body">If the target essence is a source essence or root essence, it must first be loosed before it can be moved (see Loose Essence), and then it must be bound again (with Bind Essence) before it will stay at a location. </p>
			<p class="Body">At the end of the Move’s duration, the essence will travel back to its original place or container (unless the essence is rebound, then after the Bind duration it will return). During its travel, if the distance is significant, it may disperse, get lost, or forget to return. Generally, the essence travels at a walking speed. The essence should not have to travel more than one week (as the crow flies) or else it will become a scattered essence (it may become a ghost, absorbed into an environment, or dissipate into death). If this takes place, the body remains in a husk-like state until its source essence returns.</p>
			<p class="Title">Hold/Move Object </p>
			<p class="Costs">Hold Object</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/4SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell restricts the movement of a non-sentient object by controlling its underlying essence field. This may be used defensively. </p>
			<p class="Body">The object may not be sentient and cannot be considered directly bound to, held by, or otherwise connected to a sentient being (the object’s essence field cannot be tethered to a sentient being’s essence). The magnitude of the Hold is equal to the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the WE of the object is less than the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total, it is held in place. When the spell ceases, the object’s inertia (if applicable) will return to it.</p>
			<p class="Body">This spell is channeled and costs 4SN per round. Duration increases the magnitude of the spell instead of the duration’s effectiveness. Each Duration adds another stack of the caster’s Alchemy Lore to Hold’s WE.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Move Object</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/20SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">This spell moves an object by controlling its underlying essence field. </p>
			<p class="Body">The object may not be sentient and cannot be considered directly bound to, held by, or otherwise connected to a sentient being (the object’s essence field cannot be tethered to a sentient being’s essence). If the object is in some way attached to sentient essence then the caster is only able to hold the object (the rules of Hold Object apply, but costs 20SN instead of 4 to channel). </p>
			<p class="Body">The magnitude of the Move Object is equal to the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total. If the object’s WE is less than this magnitude, the object may be moved slowly (up to 5 Units per Round). If the WE of the object is less than the caster’s Alchemy Lore Skill (not total), it may move swifty (up to 20 units per round). A swift moving object may be used to deal damage, like an attack. </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell is channeled and costs 20SN per round. Duration increases this rune like it normally would (but unlike Hold Object). Magnify adds to both of the Alchemy Lore modifiers and the speed capable of moving.</p>

			<p class="Costs">Improve</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/2SN] </p>

			<p class="Title">Inscribe/Erase Record </p>
			<p class="Costs">Inscribe Record</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5Min/1 removed from Max SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster permanently inscribes a 10-second, sensory experience from a memory or imagination into target written words. The experience can only consist of one sense at a time. The written words must already exist before they are inscribed with magic.</p>
			<p class="Body">The record is stored as long as the words are legible or until the record is erased (magically). Anyone reading the words vividly experiences the illusion recorded in the words. For example, if the caster chooses the written phrase “beautiful voice of a songbird,” they may record the sound of a voice singing (from their memory or imagination) for up to ten seconds. Whoever reads the words experiences the illusion stored. Note: while the recorded experience may be incredible, powerful, or terrifying, it can be resisted by the reader (understood to be merely an illusion). </p>
			<p class="Body">The reader may resist experiencing the stored illusion in one of three ways: If the reader already knows that the writing contains an illusory experience, if the reader is not able to read the actual words, or the reader may attempt to roll Willpower or Courage check against the caster’s Inscription. </p>
			<p class="Body">Inscribing a record costs the caster no Sanity, but their Maximum Sanity is permanently lowered by 1 for as long as the record exists. </p>
			<p class="Body">Duration increases the length of a sensory experience in 10-second intervals. Unexpectedly, Bounce can actually be used to increase the number of senses that the inscribed record contains. A Mundane Permanent glyph changes the Maximum Sanity reduction to a Sanity cost of 5, but Duration may not be used in conjunction with it.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Erase Record</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[4PT/4SN]</p>

			<p class="Costs">[3Min/1SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster attempts to understand the details of an entity, gaining a bonus of 2d20 to a specific Analyze maneuver (appropriate Lore must be used by the caster). This spell may only be used on living, sentient, entities. </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell attempts to reveal the underlying, unique essence of the entity, what Lore type is most effective against the entity, and if the entity has its essence tethered or bound somewhere. This will not reveal where or what the tethered or bound thing is, however.</p>
			<p class="Body">The SN cost for this rune may be removed if the caster is touching some part of the entity (this could be the entity itself, hairs, excrements, etc). </p>
			<p class="Body">Duration reduces the casting time of this spell in one minute intervals, up to a minimum of one PT (the third duration causes this to take one PT to cast).</p>
			<p class="Costs">Shroud</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/6SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target is immune to Scan/Inspect, Investigate, and Analyze maneuvers for 6 hours. May be used out of turn.</p>
			<p class="Body">The target must be a living, sentient entity. Using Shroud leaves no record or way to determine that the target has been shrouded, but the target just appears very difficult to understand. </p>

			<p class="Costs">Open Mystical Storage Access</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1PT/3SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Within the Essence Realm, one unique storage area exists for every person and it holds WE equal to their Alchemy Lore. </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell opens access to the caster’s personal storage, by using a non-sentient object as a medium for ten minutes. In order for the caster to deposit or withdraw from their storage (using Enable Mystical Deposit or Withdrawal), they must first cast this spell. Items placed within the storage are stored permanently until removed. </p>
			<p class="Body">But note that while the caster’s storage access has been opened, anyone can cast Deposit or Withdrawal on the caster’s personal storage. For this rune, the object’s two longest dimensions (length, width, or height) serve as the two-dimensional plane with which any items may enter or exit the storage. Note that these two dimensions become the size limitations for items entering or exiting the Mystical Storage. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Close Mystical Storage</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5PT/9SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster closes an open Mystical Storage. This costs no SN if the caster themselves opened the Storage (and it is their own). This may be used out of turn.</p>
			<p class="Title">Onus/Abjection (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Onus</p>
			<p class="Costs">[6PT/12SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster uses Command to force the target’s current offensive action to be used against either an ally of the target or the target themselves instead of its intended target. Each time the caster uses this on the same target, their ability to resist it increases +100% from their base resistance. Using Magnify does not double anything but instead removes this penalty. May be used out of turn.</p>
			<p class="Body">If used with Weaken, this rune can only be whispered and will not have the previous effects when used. Instead when weakened, Onus can be used to roll a Command maneuver on a target psychically. If used with Sneak, it gains a +4d20 bonus.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Abjection</p>

			<p class="Body _idGenParaOverride-1">Target is crippled with depression. Every  PT spent during the target’s turn expends 100 Stamina while every PT spent out of turn costs double. This is channeled and lasts for one round per 20SN.</p>

			<p class="Costs">Seizure</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[4PT/6SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target erratically and violently shakes for one round. This does not affect an entire entity, but only the specific area targeted (limb or general region). </p>
			<p class="Body">If this is used on an entity’s limb, any maneuvers performed by the specific target must roll against the caster’s Spell Total before taking action, or else the target violently shakes instead. </p>
			<p class="Body">If used on an object or material, it vibrates intensely. Holding or grabbing the object requires rolling against the Caster’s Spell Total in order to do so. No more than one cubic unit may be affected by this spell, if it was used on a material. </p>
			<p class="Title">Penetrate/Invite (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Penetrate</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/6SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Target reads the mind and thoughts of something. Caster must spend adequate time channeling relative to the thought/intention of their target. (In order to understand thirty seconds of thought/action of a target, they must channel for thirty seconds.) This spell is channeled and costs 6SN per 30 seconds.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a Recall is being used simultaneously with Penetrate, the caster will understand both what their target experienced and thought during a memory. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Invite</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[8PT/18SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster’s target may read the caster’s mind and thoughts for 30 seconds. The caster may choose what about their thoughts they wish to reveal. This may be used out of turn.</p>
			<p class="Body">If anything, the caster can choose simply to communicate to the target (and may attempt any social maneuvers, spending resources accordingly). </p>
			<p class="Body">If this is used on an unsuspecting target, the caster will gain +4d20 to using any social maneuvers against them. If the caster uses other social spells on a target while simultaneously casting Invite, they may roll twice for their maneuver, and choose the best of both rolls. </p>
			<p class="Title">Recall/Envision (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Recall</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/5SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Character experiences the memories of their target. Recall may also be used on inanimate things to discover their history. Note: only the senses of the memory are perceived by the caster (sight, touch, et cetera). This spell is channeled and costs 5SN per 30 seconds. </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster must spend adequate time channeling relative to the memory of their target. (In order to experience thirty seconds of a memory of the target, they must channel for thirty seconds.) </p>
			<p class="Body">In order to understand the intentions, interpretations, or thoughts of their target during their memory, the caster must also use Penetrate simultaneously. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Envision</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/14SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster invites the target to experience the caster’s memories, in the same way that Recall works. This spell is channeled and costs 4SN per 30 seconds.</p>
			<p class="Body">However, if this is used on a target attempting to multi-task, they receive -15 to all maneuvers for this rune’s duration. </p>
			<p class="Body">If this is used on an unsuspecting target, they must also roll against all Willpower or Courage checks that the caster had to endure during the memory they choose to share with their target. </p>
			<p class="Title">Remove/Create Memory (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Remove Memory</p>
			<p class="Costs">[30Min/12SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster may remove up to 30 seconds of a specific memory from their target for one day. </p>
			<p class="Body">In order to target a specific memory, the caster needs to have used Recall or Store Mind. If Recall or Store Mind have not been used prior to this rune, then the most immediate 30 seconds of memory before the spell began casting is removed. </p>
			<p class="Body">A Duration glyph both increases the time of the memory removed in 30 second increments and the removal time by 1 day.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Create Memory</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[30Min/30SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Up to 30 seconds of memory may be created within the target after 30 minutes of casting. The memory created lasts for 1 day. A Duration glyph both increases the time of the memory in 30 second increments and the time it lasts by 1 day.</p>
			<p class="Title">Scry/Ply </p>
			<p class="Costs">Scry</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/1SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster moves their perspective to a target. Caster can see, hear, and smell using their target as a central location. </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster’s essence must be bound to their target in order to use Scry. The caster may use a part of their own body (fluids, hair, etc) or an object which they have bound their essence to. This spell is channeled and costs 1SN per 30 seconds. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Ply</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/12SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster moves their perspective through an object to the entity that the object belongs to. The object must either have someone’s essence bound to it or it must be part of the target’s body (fluids, hair, et cetera). </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell is channeled and costs 12SN per 30 seconds. If the object does not have bound essence (but is merely part of the entity’s body), this spell costs 24SN and only lasts 10 seconds per channel instead. Using Magnify with this rune will remove the additional difficulty when casting without explicitly bound essence.  </p>
			<p class="Title">Send/Receive Telescript (social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Send Telescript</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1PT/1SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster may write a message onto any surface in sight for up to one minute and it remains at that location for five minutes. If this spell is whispered, the target will transcribe whatever the caster speaks.</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster may also write onto an object they have bound their essence to, whether it is in sight or not for 0SN. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster does not use Direct, the message appears on themselves. The shape of the text is identical to the legibility of the caster, but the text glows ever so slightly with a reddish-orange shimmer and can be read in any level of brightness. Duration glyph increases both the length of the writing time and the length of time that the writing remains at its location.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Receive Telescript</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5Min/5SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster’s target will display any message written on any objects the caster has bound their essence to (using Bind Essence). </p>
			<p class="Body">For example, a targeted piece of paper will show text that has been written onto a rock that the caster had bound their essence to. The received telescription will write both past and present written texts, so long as they still exist in written form in the present. The target will display written text for up to one hour.</p>
			<p class="Title">Send/Receive Televoice (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Send Televoice</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/5SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster may throw their voice onto any surface in sight for up to one minute. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster may also speak from an object they have bound their essence to, whether it is in sight or not for 0SN. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster does not use Direct, the message simply comes from themselves (anywhere on their body). </p>
			<p class="Body">The volume of the caster’s voice is limited to their own vocal capability (even though they do not have to speak to cast this), but the volume of this spell takes double effects from an Intensify glyph (if Intensify applies to the spell’s sound). Duration glyph increases the length of time that the caster may throw their voice in one minute increments.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Receive Televoice</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/10SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster’s target will “listen” to any objects the caster has bound their essence to (using Bind Essence). </p>
			<p class="Body">For example, a targeted earring will listen to everything within hearing range of a rock that the caster had bound their essence to, and anyone close to the earring can hear these sounds. The received Televoice only listens to sounds made in the present moment. The target will listen for up to one minute.</p>
			<p class="Title">Sense/Hide Essence </p>
			<p class="Costs">Sense Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/1SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster gives their target essence-vision for 1 minute. Target’s eyes turn white and is able to see colorful gas-like shapes where essence exists (within range of sight). All other forms (such as walls, the ground, or the sky) become a greyish color that is darker based on how sparse it is. (EG walls are a light grey, but the sky is almost black.)</p>
			<p class="Body">The density and stillness of the gassy object determines the strength and power of the essence, while each color generally represents an entity or object of its own. </p>
			<p class="Body">This effect works through walls and solid objects. The shape of the gassy-objects generally does not correlate to the object the essence is tied to (unless the object literally consists of nothing but essence, such as a Gollard Nymph or ghost of some kind), but the size does. </p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-2"><span class="Italic">(Quick-Guide for Sense Essence):</span></p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-7"><span class="Body-Bold">Color:</span> A target has one color, not more.</p>

			<p class="Costs">Hide Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/12SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster hides the essence field of the target, making it disappear from view for 6 Hours. </p>
			<p class="Body">This rune can apply to souls, spells, environmental magic, items, or any source of essence. The target essence cannot exceed more than 2 cubic units in volume. </p>
			<p class="Title">Sharpen/Dull </p>
			<p class="Costs">Sharpen</p>
			<p class="Costs">[4PT/2SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster sharpens their target. This may be used out of turn. Lasts 1 Round.</p>
			<p class="Body">Cast on an entity: Target cannot fumble or automatically fail any roll. This overrides other effects.</p>
			<p class="Body">Weapon (only if capable of being sharp): +3/4/5/6 Health Damage and +30/40/50/60 Stamina Damage.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Dull</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[6PT/15SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster dulls their target. This may be used out of turn. Lasts 1 Round.</p>
			<p class="Body">Cast on an entity: All Erudtion, Wits, and Prestige maneuvers made by the target must roll twice and choose the lowest of the two rolls. If Magnified: no roll is made at all.</p>
			<p class="Body">Weapon: Cannot deal Health Damage. If magnified: moves used with weapon cannot deal health damage either.</p>
			<p class="Title">Shrink/Grow </p>
			<p class="Costs">Shrink</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5PT/Varies] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to make something shrink up to one size-type smaller for one minute. The starting size of the target determines the SN cost of this rune. If the target is an item, the SN cost is the same as the Size-PT of the item (mentioned below). If the target is a body part, the conversion is as follows (based on the max health of the limb): 1-9 = 1SN, 10-34 = 2SN, 35-79 = 4SN, 80-199 = 8SN, 200+ = 16SN, colossal = 32SN.</p>
			<p class="Body">For items’ size scale: tiny = 2PT, small = 3PT, medium = 4PT, large = 5PT, and huge = 6PT. </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell can have dramatic effects: Weapons cost 1 less PT, armor might constrict the wearer (multiplying all worn-armor disadvantages by five), body parts are considered 25% smaller and therefore follow different size rules. </p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-7"><span class="CharOverride-4">Grow</span></p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[6PT/Varies]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to make something grow up to one size-type larger for one minute. Grow uses the same size charts as Shrink, when determining Sanity costs. </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell can have dramatic effects: Melee weapons cost 50% more PT, armor loosely fits the wearer (which doubles all worn disadvantages), and limbs/body parts are considered 50% larger and therefore easier to hit.</p>
			<p class="Title">Store/Retreive Snapshot </p>
			<p class="Costs">Store Snapshot</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1PT/1SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster emblazons a perfect, 10-second (one round) memory into their target during the next hour. Upon using this rune the caster may choose which ten seconds in the following hour they wish to use for Snapshot.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster does not use Direct glyph, they store the memory in their own mind. If the caster targets another entity or object, it will gain the memory but know that it is not its own.</p>
			<p class="Body">The snapshot memory is considered perfect, it lasts forever, and remembering the exact details requires no memory check. However, the caster may only have one snapshot stored at a time. If the caster stored their snapshot on a target instead of themselves, the memory must be accessed using Recall or Retreive Snapshot. </p>
			<p class="Body">If this is used with Arcane Permanence, the target item will store all of the caster’s memory from the point of casting until the caster’s death. </p>
			<p class="Body">If this is used with Mundane Permanence, the snapshot will not count towards the one-snapshot maximum.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Retreive Snapshot</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1Min/3SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster may access any and all snapshot memories stored on their target.</p>
			<p class="Title">Strengthen/Weaken </p>
			<p class="Costs">Strengthen</p>
			<p class="Costs">[4PT/10SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster strengthens their target. This may be used out of turn. Lasts 1 Round.</p>
			<p class="Body">Entity: Target gains +25 to all defense, resistance, or maneuvers used defensively. If out of combat: target gains +4d20 to their next Physique, Wellness, or Nerve maneuver.</p>
			<p class="Body">Object: Add Lore Total to DUR. If weapon: damage rolls are maxed as well. If armor: MIT is doubled.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Weaken</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[9PT/16SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster weakens their target. This may be used out of turn. Lasts 1 Round.</p>
			<p class="Body">Entity: All Physique, Wellness, Grace, and Prowess maneuvers made by the target must roll twice and choose the lowest of the two rolls. If Magnified: no roll is made at all. </p>
			<p class="Body">Object: DUR Total is temporarily reduced by Lore Total. Weapons cannot add any dice damage and armor’s MIT is halved.</p>
			<p class="Title">Teleport/Summon </p>
			<p class="Costs">Teleport</p>
			<p class="Costs">[9PT/5SN + 1SN per 5WE] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster teleports their target to a location in sight. The landing location must be of greater mass (WE) than the thing being teleported (for example, a person cannot be teleported onto a tightrope, but a feather could be). This rune costs 5SN plus an additional 1SN for every 5WE of strength the caster wishes to use. The caster’s declared strength must exceed the WE of the target or else the spell fails. The caster may use this out of turn only if cast on themselves or an ally defensively. </p>
			<p class="Body">Radius, Cone, and Bounce do not increase or increase strength of spell, only number of targets hit. The total WE of all targets must still be less than the original strength of the spell. Stacks of Duration I and II add 3WE per stack to the strength (e.g. using one stack of duration increases the effectiveness to 1SN per 8WE). Duration III adds 5WE per stack to the strength.</p>
			<p class="Body">Note: Range glyph only applies to the spell’s target, not the teleportation location since this is determined by caster’s sight. As a tip, the WE of a target is the total Health of all their limbs combined. This calculation is doubled for Immense and tripled for Colossal creatures.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Summon</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5Min/1SN per 10WE]</p>
			<p class="Body">Summon works the same as Teleport, except that a target within sight may be moved to a location within their spell’s range.</p>
			<p class="Title">Torment/Cure (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Torment</p>
			<p class="Costs">[4PT/7SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster deals 2d20 damage to target’s Sanity. This cannot deal Trauma Effects.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Cure</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[4PT/8SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target heals +2d6 Sanity. This cannot be used with Contain, Ruminate, or Duration glyphs.</p>
			<p class="Title">Track/Lose Essence </p>
			<p class="Costs">Track Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">[9PT/3SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster targets an item or object that has an essence tether in order to navigate toward that target’s source-essence (the entity to which the bound or tethered essences belong). This spell may only be portaled. </p>
			<p class="Body">If successful, this rune functions like an internal compass that physically suggests (with a feeling like a magnet) the direction the caster would need to travel in order to reach the source of essence they are looking for. This rune tracks this “string” to find the point it originates from. However, the caster is not able to see the string when casting this spell, they can only “feel” its pull in a general direction. Because of this, the benefit of this spell is allowing the caster to follow-up and roll a Tracking maneuver with this additional evidence.</p>
			<p class="Body">Typically if a target binds their essence to something, they create a magical tether (like a thin line of string, made of magic) between their soul-essence and the object they have bound to. </p>
			<p class="Body">In addition, any piece of a person (their hair, skin, nails, fluids or other products of their body) also leaves a small tether to their source essence. </p>
			<p class="Body">And lastly, all entities with a soul or source-essence (whether sentient or not) leave a small tether on anything touched, which is detectable for at least 3 hours. (To note, this kind of tether is not bound as strongly as the previously mentioned tethers). </p>
			<p class="Body">That being said, if the caster is attempting to locate an item that they have bound their own essence to, this rune costs 0SN and does not require a Direct glyph. </p>
			<p class="Body">Combining Sense Essence with this rune allows the caster to actually see the essence string’s exact direction for the full duration of this rune, causing the Track maneuver to automatically succeed.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Lose Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[10Min/6SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster causes the target’s essence to become untrackable for 6 hours. The target’s source-essence becomes loosely bound (instead of fully bound) to all of its own extensions. This rune may target an entity directly or any tether of an entity.</p>
			<p class="Body">This causes an object or a sentient entity to become immune to Track Essence, Scry/Ply, Send/Receive Telescript or Televoice, or any other rune which requires locating a bound piece of essence or a bound essence’s source. During this time, the target’s source essence cannot use anything that they may have been bound to because it is temporarily “lost” to them and they are “lost” to it. </p>
			<p class="Body">All essence may still be seen through Sense Essence or manipulated using any other regular method (such as Loose Essence or Hold Essence). The essence is still present with the target it belongs to, but it just drops off the radar, so to speak (which is why it cannot be found, tracked, scryed, or otherwise utilized). At the end of this duration, the target essence reconnects (it is “found” again) and retethers itself fully to its source.</p>
			<p class="Title">Understand/Confound </p>
			<p class="Costs">Understand</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3Min/1SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster attempts to understand the contents (essence, material, or otherwise) of a non-sentient object, gaining a bonus of +2d20 to a specific (Alchemy Lore) Analyze maneuver. </p>
			<p class="Body">This rune may be used to do one of the following (caster must choose): </p>
			<p class="Body">1. Learn the contents, owner, and WE (current and total) of a mystical storage open on an item. </p>
			<p class="Body">2. Learn any runes or glyphs stored on an object (trigger or enchantment). </p>
			<p class="Body">3. Learn the material type of an object and possibly its ownership (whoever made it and whoever currently has their essence bound to it). </p>
			<p class="Body">4. Get a general understanding of whatever the object contains or does (what actions the object is capable of, what other objects/entities are within the object, or, in the case of a book, what its general message entails). </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster must roll Alchemy Lore to properly understand one of these four things about the object. Alchemy Lore difficulty is increased based on the spells, owners, or general complexity of the object and the caster may only partially understand whatever the object entails.</p>
			<p class="Body">Duration reduces the casting time of this spell in one minute intervals, up to a minimum of one PT (the third duration causes this to take one PT to cast).</p>
			<p class="Costs">Confound</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/6SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target is immune to Scan/Inspect, Understand, and Analyze maneuvers for 6 hours. May be used out of turn.</p>
			<p class="Body">The target must be a non-sentient object. Using Confound leaves no record or way to determine that the target has been confounded, the target just appears very difficult to understand.</p>
			<p class="Title">Urging/Paranoia (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Urging</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/8SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster uses Convince to force the target’s current beneficial action to be used against either the caster or an ally of the caster instead of its intended target. If it as an area of effect benefit, it will benefit all of the caster’s allies. Each time the caster uses this on the same target, their ability to resist it increases +100% from their base resistance. Using Magnify does not double anything but instead removes this penalty. May be used out of turn.</p>
			<p class="Body">If used with Weaken, this rune can only be whispered and will not have the previous effects when used. Instead when weakened, Urging can be used to roll a Command maneuver on a target psychically. If used with Sneak, it gains a +4d20 bonus.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Paranoia</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[6PT/24SN]</p>
			<p class="Body _idGenParaOverride-1">Target becomes overwhelmed with paranoia for one round. They add d100 to their passive Perception against stealthed targets but all health damage taken is also dealt to Sanity.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading ParaOverride-7">Category 1 Illegal Runes: </p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Primordial</p>
			<p class="Body">The spells in this category are considered illegal if practiced within any region or nation where the Magisterium has power of law. However, these spells are not persecuted by the Magisterium if a native of a non-Magisterium region or nation uses these spells in their homeland. </p>
			<p class="Body">If a shaman or druid visits somewhere their spells would be considered illegal, they may go to the local Inquisitor’s Office and receive a permit for their stay (or they can refrain from using any magic). </p>
			<p class="Body">If a permit is attained, the practicing shaman or druid may be allowed to use their magic according to the regular laws of licensed wizardry. Permits are generally restricted to one-region, one-visit rules and do not transfer between cities or areas. </p>
			<p class="Body">In summary, these spells are only legal for recognized, practicing shaman and druids.</p>
			<p class="Title">Attune/Infuse Essence (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Attune Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5Min/5SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to attune their essence to a target, living entity for one week. This attunement creates a tether to the target entity that makes the caster more empathetic to the target entity. Casting this on the self has no effect, everyone is already attuned to themselves. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster gains the ability to sense whatever feelings the target has for the duration. The caster will know if the target feels fear, pain, joy, happiness, or any other sort of feeling. In addition to this, all spells cast upon the target by the caster gain a +10 modifier and refund 1d3SN per spell. If the target dies or the tether is otherwise broken, the Attunement ends.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster uses Magnify with this rune, they will feel the same things the target feels. This will link both SN and Stamina damage to be experienced by the caster as well (not Health damage, though). The caster will take 50% of Stamina and SN damage on behalf of the target. Only one entity may be attuned with Magnify at one time. Attuning to a new entity will sever the caster’s previous connection. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Infuse Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5min/8SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to give their essence as a gift to target entity, joining them in a deep bond of empathy. The caster must already be attuned to the entity and the entity must consent to the Infuse spell. The duration ends when the caster’s Attune duration ends.</p>
			<p class="Body">Both the entity and the caster will understand each other’s feelings, intentions, and actions. They will form a subconscious bond to one another and will share in a non-verbal comprension and compassion for one another. </p>
			<p class="Body">Due to the emotional nature of this connection, if either the target or the caster dies while this spell is active, the other will suffer a traumatic loss of [4d6+12SN] damage.</p>
			<p class="Title">Dismiss/Beckon Fauna (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Dismiss Fauna</p>
			<p class="Costs">[6PT/SN Spent Equal to Size]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target fauna creature is compelled to flee from the caster for at least one hour. This rune may be used defensively. </p>
			<p class="Body">The size of fauna determines the SN cost of this rune: tiny = 1SN, small = 2SN, medium = 4SN, large = 6SN, huge = 8SN. Colossal creatures require Magnify glyph and 8SN.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Beckon Fauna</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[1Min/2d6SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to commune with nature and request an animal ally to aid them. The beckoning spell lasts for ten minutes and then the creature will peacefully leave the caster’s presence (if possible). Note: special or magical entities cannot be beckoned with this rune.</p>
			<p class="Body">When using this rune, the caster specifies what they need aid with (help fighting, a temporary ride, etc). A creature will arrive and attempt to help (but the size is depending, see below). The beckoned creature will always obey the caster, unless the caster tries to harm the creature. Despite this understanding, the caster cannot communicate with the creature beckoned (unless they have another way to do so). </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell always targets the nearby environment, using the caster’s Nature Lore. The SN spent from the 2d6 roll determines the strength of this rune: </p>
			<p class="Body">The roll determines the creature’s size:</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-7">2 = Tiny </p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-7">3 to 7 = Small </p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-7">8 to 10 = Medium </p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-7">11 = Large</p>
			<p class="Body">12 = Huge </p>
			<p class="Body">If the rolled creature size is not available nearby (at host’s discretion), then the next most available size may be chosen. Note that the SN spent does not change. However if no fauna are available nearby at all, then no SN is spent and the spell fails after its casting. Using Magnify with this rune reduce casting time to 15PT and doubles the duration, but has no other effect.</p>
			<p class="Title">Dismiss/Beckon Flora (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Dismiss Flora </p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/4SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target living flora withers and shrinks and remains paralyzed for one hour. This rune affects up to 50 cubic units of flora matter. This rune may be used defensively. The target plant has no strength and a DUR of 0 during this time.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Beckon Flora</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[6PT/1d6SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to commune with the earth and request a living plant entity to aid them, sprouting from target location. This rune may be used defensively. The plant will fade away after one round.</p>
			<p class="Body">The target location must have natural earth, access to natural earth, or be a plant entity itself. This spell always targets the nearby environment, using the caster’s Nature Lore. </p>
			<p class="Body">The result of the roll for SN determines the size and strength of the beckoned Flora: </p>
			<p class="Body">1 = flora is equivalent to delicate flowers. </p>
			<p class="Body">2 to 3 = a vine with a strength of the caster’s [Nature Lore] and a reach of 2 units from target location. </p>
			<p class="Body">4 to 5 = a thick branch with a strength of the caster’s [Nature Lore +10] and a reach of 3 units from target location. </p>
			<p class="Body">6 = a massive ent-like tree or equivalent with a strength of the caster’s [Nature Lore +25] and reach of 4 units. </p>
			<p class="Body">Radius increases the reach of the plant in two unit intervals, while Magnify increases the strength of the plant. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster specifies what single action the beckoned plant must do (grapple, attack, block, hold, grow from beneath them and lift them, etc). If this rune is used defensively, then only a Block, Grab, or Lift (on the caster) may be chosen.</p>
			<p class="Body">If used to attack or grab, the aim is determined by the plant’s strength. If an attack, the damage dealt is equivalent to a SM/6 attack that deals [3d20 + the Plant’s Strength]. The plant instantly regenerates any damage it takes, so it is considered virtually indestructable during its duration.</p>
			<p class="Title">Dismiss/Beckon Heavens (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Dismiss Heavens</p>
			<p class="Costs">[10Min/SN Spent Equal to Conditions]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster targets the heavens using their Nature Lore and attempts to dismiss adverse weather conditions in a local-sized area. In addition to removing bad weather, this rune will fend off any new adverse weather from entering the region for 12 hours.</p>
			<p class="Body">This rune automatically targets the environment, so Direct and Range are not necessary. Radius increases this rune to region-sized area. Radius and Magnify increase this rune to a national-sized area. </p>
			<p class="Body">The cost of this rune is determined by how fierce the weather conditions are: </p>
			<p class="Body">Mild (foggy, cloudy, little wind, no precipitation) = 5SN, Moderate (overcast, moderate precipitation, mild winds) = 10SN, Severe (stormy, violent precipitation, strong winds) = 18SN. </p>
			<p class="Body">If Weaken is used with this rune, then a radius of 5 units from the caster’s target location (they may choose to use Direct and Range to specify) is cleared of all adverse weather conditions for one hour and this Rune cannot cost more than 8SN (after Weaken’s refund). Also, Weaken reduces the casting time of this rune to 9PT instead of 10 minutes.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Beckon Heavens</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5Min/3d6SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to commune with the heavens and beckon a local-sized storm over caster’s current area for one hour. Radius increases this rune to region-sized area. Radius and Magnify increase this rune to a national-sized area. </p>
			<p class="Body">This rune automatically targets the environment, so Direct and Range are not necessary. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster’s roll for SN cost determines the strength of the storm: </p>
			<p class="Body">3 to 6 = a light cloud cover move in with a little wind and misty precipitation. </p>
			<p class="Body">7 to 14 = full cloud cover, steady precipitation, and moderate winds. </p>
			<p class="Body">15 to 18 = a heavy storm, with dark coverage, violent winds, and fierce precipitation. In addition, there is a 2 in 6 chance for thunder and lightning as well. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster uses Weaken with this rune, then a tiny cloud appears at the caster’s target location for one round (they must use Direct and Range accordingly). Using Weaken will also reduce the casting time of this rune to 12PT. The roll for SN cost determines the radius size (in units) of the cloud effect. The dense cloud lowers all Awareness maneuvers, attacks, and defenses into or out of the radius by a value equal to the caster’s [Nature Lore].</p>
			<p class="Body">If Impact is used with this weakened rune, then a microstorm appears instead of a dense cloud. The microstorm has a 33% chance (a roll of 5 or 6 on a d6) to attack any unit within the radius when the spell is cast. In addition, any entity that enters the radius, leaves the radius, or is within the radius when the storm fades (after its duration ends) has a 33% chance to be struck.</p>
			<p class="Body">The attack dealt is a dash of lightning, dealing close to the equivalent of Conjure Electricity: </p>
			<p class="Body">SK/4 [8H + Caster’s Nature Lore Total x2 as Stamina Damage + Impact Damage]. If target is metallic or immersed in water, damage is [8H + Caster’s Nature Lore Total x4 as Stamina Damage + Impact Damage]. These attacks automatically hit, and roll on the glance table for placement location (with the center being the target’s highest-mass body part). </p>
			<p class="Title">Hold/Move Entity</p>
			<p class="Costs">Hold Entity</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/9SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell restricts the movement of an entity by controlling its underlying essence field. This may be used defensively. </p>
			<p class="Body">The magnitude of the hold is equal to the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total. If the WE of the entity is less than the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total, it is held in place. This spell is channeled and costs 9SN per round. Duration increases the magnitude of the spell instead of the rounds channelled. Each Duration adds another stack of the caster’s Alchemy Lore to Hold’s WE.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Move Entity</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[Channeled/24SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">This spell moves an entity by controlling its underlying essence field. </p>
			<p class="Body">The magnitude of Move Entity is equal to the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total. If the entity’s WE is less than this magnitude, the object may be moved slowly (up to 3 Units per Round). If the WE of the entity is less than the caster’s Alchemy Lore Skill (not total), it may move swifty (up to 20 units per round). A swift moving entity may be used to deal damage, like an attack (and will also take damage itself). </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell is channeled and costs 24SN per round. Duration increases the number of rounds this may be channeled per 24SN (as it typically would, unlike Hold Entity). Magnify adds to both of the Alchemy Lore modifiers and the speed capable of moving.</p>
			<p class="Title">Listen/Speak to Nature (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Listen to Nature</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1PT/1SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster gains the ability to listen to the natural language of a target flora or fauna entity for 5 minutes. This rune may be used defensively. </p>
			<p class="Body">Note: typically flora are just observant, meaning they will only talk about observations (flora are known to gossip about their observations across large regions, however). But fauna are capable of slightly more interesting or insightful comments, but tend to be focused more on themselves or their social interests.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Speak to Nature</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[4PT/4SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Same as Listen to Nature, except that the caster can also speak to target flora or fauna. The caster may use any social maneuvers on their target while also listening.</p>
			<p class="Title">Non-Sentient/Sentient Morph </p>
			<p class="Costs">Non-Sentient Morph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[12PT/15SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster morphs their target into a new entity type for 3 rounds. The target gains all of the physical and mental attributes of the entity type to use at their disposal, except for Spell Resist. If the caster uses this on themselves, the SN cost is reduced to 6SN. Using Magnify with this rune morphs the target into an identical copy of the Attuned entity, rather than merely their type.</p>
			<p class="Body">Note: By default the target entity and type is the caster themselves (since everyone is attuned to themselves by default). The caster must have attuned their essence to an entity (see Attune Essence), and then they can morph a target into that same type of entity. </p>
			<p class="Body">The entity may be sentient or not (plant or animal), but the target is no more sentient than the entity type is capable of (the target essentially becomes the same as the entity they are morphed into). The target’s motivations, goals, actions, and even Lore Type will reflect the sort of entity they are morphed into. </p>
			<p class="Body">In addition, the Maximum Sanity of the target is altered to match the Maximum Sanity of their new entity type. Because even the brain is morphed, the target will not remember anything that was experienced while they were morphed. </p>
			<p class="Body">All damage taken while morphed is restored when the morph ends (the target’s state before the morph is returned to them). However, the morph will automatically end if any of these values pass below zero: Chest, Death, or Head Health, Stamina, or Sanity. (The target is immediately unmorphed back to their original form when any of these values reaches below zero.)</p>
			<p class="Body">Using Weaken with this rune will only morph a single body part of the target into a similar or corresponding body part of the new entity (scaled to match the target’s body). At most, this may functionally only grant one additional ability (target gains no extra benefits from this rune, including loss of sentience, health gain, etc). Morphing the head or brain of the target into the entity’s will remove the target’s sentience in addition to gaining the one ability. </p>
			<p class="Body">Due to the complexity of this rune (including with Weaken) the Host may decide against unplanned or spontaneous uses of this rune or require the character to invest Shape, Plot, or Gift points in order to use extra abilities while morphed.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Sentient Morph</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[12PT/30SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">This has the same effect as Non-Sentient Morph, except that the target is capable of full sentience while morphed, rather than being limited to the mental capacity and decisions of their entity type. However, this rune only lasts one round instead. If the caster uses this on themselves, the SN cost is reduced to 10SN.</p>
			<p class="Body _idGenParaOverride-1">In addition to the target remaining fully sentient, they also retain their personal Sanity while morphed (it will not be restored if the morph fades and reaching zero will not remove the morph either). The caster also retains their own Erudition, Wits, Prestige, and Nerve (and respective maneuvers)</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading ParaOverride-7">Category 2 Illegal Runes: </p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading ParaOverride-7">Necromancy, Pithology, Exalchemy, Pneuomatology, Chronomancy</p>
			<p class="Body">The spells in this category are considered universally illegal; no circumstances exist where the practice, use, or application of these is permissible by law. </p>
			<p class="Body">Any willful casting, possession, or study of these runes is considered punishable by the laws of the Magisterium. On rare occasions, some of these runes are permitted for study by the Magisterium, but only with a full-council approval and careful control and observation. </p>
			<p class="Body">Typically, the lawbreaker will be dealt with by swift elimination, typically via a team of Rangers and Templar. Less serious crimes may be handled with a permanent license revocation (if used by a licensed magic practitioner) as well as a minimum confinement of 15 years in prison. The guilty will also have a memory wipe, all essence tethers will be unbound and destroyed, and permanent monitoring will be established to ensure no more magic is ever used by the individual.</p>
			<p class="Title">Absorb/Reflect Essence </p>
			<p class="Costs">Absorb Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">[9PT/24SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">This rune can do one of two things: absorb spells or absorb environmental essence. This rune may be used defensively. </p>
			<p class="Body">To absorb a spell, the Caster chooses a non-essence target (general objects or entities) which will automatically absorb the next spell that is used on the caster, leaving the caster completely unaffected. The target of this takes the spell’s effect’s instead, but only at one quarter effectiveness. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster chooses themselves as the target of absorbtion, then they still take the full effect of the next incoming spell made against them, but also absorb one quarter of the SN spent to cast the spell. The absorbtion will protect the caster for one day, or until a spell is cast onto the caster. </p>
			<p class="Body">To absorb a form of environmental essence, the caster must target it and attempt to cast this spell. The environmental essence may give the caster strange, powerful, or deadly enhancements that can last for a short time (or permanently). Each environment may have a different effect when absorbed.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Reflect Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[9PT/0SN + SN Equal to Essence Reflected]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster’s target gains a protective aura for one round with a power equal to the caster’s Essence Lore total. This rune may be used defensively. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the next incoming spell fails to exceed the aura’s power (irrespective of the target’s Spell Resist), then the spell is reflected back to its caster. The reflected spell immediately succeeds on its caster as if they had targeted themselves. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the aura succeeds in reflecting, the SN cost for this rune is calculated as equal to the total SN cost of the spell being reflected. The aura will dissipate after it has reflected a spell successfully or its duration runs out.</p>
			<p class="Body">If Weaken is used with this, the rune costs 5SN (instead of being determined by the spell reflected) and the aura lasts for one round, affecting all incoming spells during this time. All spells that are resisted naturally (by the target themselves, not caster’s Essence Lore) have a 5% chance of reflecting onto their caster.</p>
			<p class="Title">Conjure/Dispel Being </p>
			<p class="Costs">Conjure Being</p>
			<p class="Costs">[15Min/45SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to conjure a being into existence from the realm of essence for one hour. This rune requires reagents for specific beings to be conjured. If no reagents or improper reagents are used, then a Vapor of Essence is conjured. For entities and information related to required reagents, see the Book of Particulars.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Dispel Being</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[30Min/90SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target entity is cast out of reality into the Realm of Essence, the Plane of Shadows, for one hour. After this duration, the entity returns to reality exactly as they left it.</p>
			<p class="Title">Conjure/Dispel Curse (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Conjure Curse</p>
			<p class="Costs">[16PT/3d6 from Max SN]</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-8">Target is cursed. The SN spent from rolling and the reagents used determine the type of curse that is applied. For curses and information related to required reagents, see the Book of Particulars.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Dispel Curse</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1Hour/SN Determined by Curse Dispelled]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster dispels target curse from entity, using the reagents required. If the caster does not possess the reagents required, they instead transfer the curse to themselves. For curses and information related to required reagents, see the Book of Particulars.</p>
			<p class="Title">Control/Enwill Husk (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Control Husk</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/30SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster attempts to attune their intentions to a target husk, animating it and giving it actions to perform for one day. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster targets the husk using their Alchemy Lore, which then determines the overall strength of their control. The husk is completely servile to the caster and will perform any actions ordered, to the best of their ability. </p>
			<p class="Body">The husk may be controlled by another however, if Control Husk is cast more powerfully by someone else (someone succeeds with a higher Alchemy Lore casting). </p>
			<p class="Body">In order for the caster to give orders to the husk, they still must use a social maneuver (and spend resources, such as PT or SN to do so). But as long as Control Husk still remains on the entity, the caster will always succeed in their maneuver. </p>
			<p class="Body">A controlled husk has Wits, Prestige, and Erudition equal to one tenth of the caster’s, while the physical stats (Physique, Wellness, Grace, and Prowess) are determined by the corpse of the husk itself. </p>
			<p class="Body">A husk is almost entirely immune to social maneuvers (other than the caster’s) so their Nerve stat is considered to be three times that of the caster’s. In addition, a controlled husk is mute and therefore cannot perform any social actions other than Comfort, Seduce, or Intimidate.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Enwill Husk</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[15Min/45SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster attempts to attune their intentions fully to a target husk, granting the husk a will of its own (although servile to the caster) for one week. </p>
			<p class="Body">In order to do this, the caster must have bound their essence to the husk (with Bind Essence). </p>
			<p class="Body">The enwilled husk will act on its own volition unless otherwise influenced by the caster, and will always act willingly in the caster’s favor (the enwilled husk would not do anything to the caster that the caster themselves would find unfavorable). </p>
			<p class="Body">An enwilled husk has Wits, Prestige, and Erudition equal to one half of the caster’s, while the physical stats (Physique, Wellness, Grace, and Prowess) are determined by the corpse of the husk itself. An enwilled husk’s Nerve is equal to the caster’s, so they are more succeptable to outside influence than a mere controlled husk. </p>
			<p class="Body">An enwilled husk can speak and has knowledge of all of the language that the caster is capable of as well as knowledge of The Language of the Dead at Rank 3. The Language of the Dead is a psychic language that can only be spoken by the recently dead (corpses that still have a tether to their soul), and can only be heard by the dead (any dead will do). </p>
			<p class="Body">While the husk is incapable of directly speaking the Language of the Dead, they can translate anything they might hear into a language that their caster could understand. (Typically dead things just talk about their death or their most distinct memories from life, over and over again.) </p>
			<p class="Body">Note that if the caster’s Bind Essence expires before the Enwill Husk expires, the enwilled husk will no longer be bound to the caster’s service, which may possibly prove to be dangerous (this is how ghouls come into being). </p>
			<p class="Body">In addition, an enwilled husk cannot have two masters (as only one essence may be bound to a given object at a time). </p>
			<p class="Body">Old necromantic tomes note that while a standard enwilled husk may prove to be somewhat dull in personality, Magnify (which increases the husk’s stats) and durations longer than a few months (or Permanence) seem to bring out unique character traits that a husk does not necessarily inherit from their master (possibly remnants of their body’s old selfhood mixed with their caster’s).</p>
			<p class="Title">Give/Take Ground-of-Essence </p>
			<p class="Costs">Give Ground-of-Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5Min/5 Death Health, 1 from Max SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster transfers 1 point from their Maximum Sanity to heal their target’s SN. This is permanent in effect. The caster takes damage to their Death Health in order to use this rune.</p>
			<p class="Body">If Mundane Permanence is used with this rune, then the amount healed to the target also adds to their Maximum Sanity. In addition, the caster permanently loses the Death Health spent to cast this rune. Each increment of Duration increases the transfer amount by 1. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Take Ground-of-Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[5PT/15 Death Health]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster transfers 1 point from their target’s maximum Sanity to heal their own SN. This is permanent in effect. The caster takes damage to their Death Health in order to use this rune.</p>
			<p class="Body">If Mundane Permanence is used with this rune, then the amount healed to the caster also adds to their maximum SN. In addition, the caster permanently loses the Death Health spent to cast this rune. Each increment of Duration increases the transfer amount by 1. </p>
			<p class="Title">Grant/Consume Youth (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Grant Youth</p>
			<p class="Costs">[18Hours/Variable SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Target gains youth in years, equal to one hundreth of the SN spent by the caster (100 SN spent grants one year of youth). </p>
			<p class="Body">Both the target and the caster lose Maximum Sanity equal to ten times the years of youth the target gained (if they are granted two years of youth, both the caster and target lose twenty maximum Sanity). Of course, if the caster is the target, they lose double the amount. </p>
			<p class="Body">This maximum Sanity loss is permanent. However, the youth gained lasts until the years run out, then the target immediately reverts to the age they would have been if the spell had not been cast. If Permanence is used with this rune, then the years of youth granted are permanent.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Consume Youth</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1Year/3650SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster consumes ten years worth of youth from their target and gains them for their own. </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell is permanent in effect to the target and the caster. For this reason, Permanence cannot be used with this rune. In addition, this rune and glyphs cannot be used with Contain. </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell must be cast on the same target for one hour every day for a full year, spending 10SN per day. The target slowly loses their youth throughout the year, but it does not transfer to the caster until the spell has completed. If the spell is not cast within a 36 hour period from its last casting (a day is skipped), then the spell breaks and the target’s youth returns to them. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the spell fails, the number of days spent casting determines the number of days it takes for the target to regain their youth. The caster may attempt to begin the spell again at any time. </p>
			<p class="Body">Glyphs used with this spell must be used at the spell’s first casting, and then all further castings (the daily ones) simply require 10SN and one hour (any modifications made to these castings are determined according to the glyphs used originally). Note: if Quicken Spell glyph is used with this, both the casting time required each day and the total number of days required are reduced. But beware: the 36 hour period required to recast is also shortened by quickening and the total Sanity cost (3650) must still be spent across the remaining days.</p>
			<p class="Title">Listen/Speak to the Dead (Social)</p>
			<p class="Costs">Listen to the Dead</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/4SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster gains the ability to listen to the Language of the Dead for 1 minute, but may only listen to the target of their spell. </p>
			<p class="Body">The target of their spell must still have a tether to their soul (recently dead, a matter of hours), or else the caster must also use Combine and Track Essence on the target. If combined with Track Essence, the target still must be somewhat freshly dead (no more than 72 hours without a tether). Typically the dead will only discuss the events of their death or their most significant memories from life (whether good or bad), unless asked direct questions (which this rune is incapable of doing).</p>
			<p class="Costs">Speak to the Dead</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[3PT/8SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">This rune is the same as Listen to the Dead, except the caster is also able to ask their target one question. </p>
			<p class="Body">The target will be unable to recognize the user, so any advantages or disadvantages that come with recognition are lost, but the caster must still use either Interrogation or Acquaint maneuvers when asking their question of the target. </p>
			<p class="Body">If their target is not willing to answer, the caster still expends the use of their question. Duration increases the time of this rune as well as the number of questions that the caster may ask, in increments of one. Magnify will double the total questions the caster may ask.</p>
			<p class="Title">Retreive/Save Chronocule</p>
			<p class="Costs">Retreive Chronocule </p>
			<p class="Costs">[2Min/20SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster retreives a Chronocule charge that is stored on a target object. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster retreives a Chronocule while they are outside of the essence realm, then the Chronocule is closed and all charges disappear. If the caster retreiving the Chronocule in this manner was the caster who stored the Chronocule originally, the lost Maximum Sanity (from Save Chronocule) is returned to them. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster is in the essence realm when they cast this spell, they travel to the time and location of the original object where the Chronocule was saved. The caster remains in the essence realm when they arrive. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster’s essence already exists in the time they travel to, they cannot leave the essence realm unless they join their own essence to their already-existing essence and body (using Join  Essence). The reason for this is because identical essence cannot co-exist outside of the essence realm unless it is joined to itself. </p>
			<p class="Body">Note: Chronocules are a one-way travel, so a Chronocule cannot take someone back to whenever they came from. Any entity touching the caster when they retreive the Chronocule travels with them, expending one charge per person (unless Radius was used with Save Chronocule, then 3 total may pass per charge). </p>
			<p class="Body">Bounce used with this rune will allow more than one target to retreive the Chronocule while only expending a single charge. Magnify used with this rune doubles the number of entities that may pass with the caster per charge expended. If the Saved Chronocule was saved with Weaken, then Duration increases the time that the caster (and fellow travelers) may view the time in one hour intervals. Using Weaken with this rune has no effect. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Save Chronocule </p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph </p>
			<p class="Costs">[1PT/(Glyph costs) + 20 from Max Sanity]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster must be within the essence realm to cast this spell. Their target object becomes a Chronocule. A Chronocule is the catalyst for a time portal. Only one Saved Chronocule may exist at a time per caster.</p>
			<p class="Body">The Chronocule saves the current state of space and time at the casting of the spell. The object that the Chronocule is stored on must not move from its location physically more than the range of the caster’s spell (if the caster uses Range with this rune, then that becomes the range that the Chronocule can move before losing all charges). </p>
			<p class="Body">Aside from this, a Chronocule only has three charges and then it disappears forever. (Retreiving the Chronocule expends one charge.) </p>
			<p class="Body">All SN spent on this rune and glyphs also subtract from the character’s Maximum Sanity. A caster can only gain back their spent Max SN if they themselves choose to close the Chronocule (an option when retreiving), as long as it has at least one charge remaining. </p>
			<p class="Body">Each stack of Duration adds one charge to the Chronocule, while Magnify doubles all charges. Radius allows up to three entities to pass through a retreived Chronocule for only one charge. If Permanence is used with this rune, then the caster may have more than one Saved Chronocule, but the total SN cost is doubled for this spell. </p>
			<p class="Body _idGenParaOverride-1">If Weaken is used with this rune, then retreiving the Chronocule only allows the user to look at the saved moment in time for up to one hour. The caster does not travel physically to that period of time, but merely views it through a lens. Weaken also removes the Maximum Sanity rule with this rune and instead this rune and glyphs used with it just cost SN like usual.</p>
			<p class="Title">Remove/Revive Soul </p>
			<p class="Costs">Remove Soul</p>
			<p class="Costs">[48Hours/240SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to remove the soul of a target, immediately killing that target upon completion of this spell, sending their soul into the Essence Realm (specifically into unreachable Plane of the Afterliving). </p>
			<p class="Body">While this spell has the permanent effect of killing the target, strangely enough the target still holds a tether to their soul (even in The Plane of Afterliving). This means that the target is very easy to revive (with Revive Soul) and communicate with (if someone has the ability to use the Language of the Dead). </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster uses Mundane Permanence with this rune, then there is no tether which binds the target to their soul and they are dead forever. Optionally, Remove Soul may be used with Weaken and it will have the exact same costs and effect as Loose Essence (see Bind/Loose Essence).</p>
			<p class="Costs">Revive Soul</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[72Hours/720SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to bring a target back to life. This spell cannot be used with Contain, Quicken, Permanence, or Magnify. </p>
			<p class="Body">Each hour of this spell costs 10SN, but up to four casters may cast this spell simultaneously (to both quicken the spell and also share the SN cost burden, by dividing the time and SN evenly among them). All simultaneous casters must cast from the beginning to the end of the spell (they cannot join partway through) and they must all have access or ability to use this rune. </p>
			<p class="Body">In order to cast this spell, the target’s body must be in a “livable” condition (any lethal wounds must be healed) and there must still exist a tether between the body and the body’s soul (typically the tether to the soul is maintained through Hold Essence). </p>
			<p class="Body">This spell does not maintain the tether to the soul, so Hold Essence must be active during this casting. In addition to these requirements, there is an unknown reason which causes 95% of this spell’s casting to fail. (A natural 20 must be rolled at this spell’s completion, or else the target’s soul becomes permanently untethered and the target perishes.) </p>
			<p class="Body">The only way to reduce this chance is for the caster (or anyone involved) to spend a very high amount of Plot Points (at least 2 for every 5% chance increase), which may be explained (from a narrative perspective) as deep love for or investment in the target being revived (those spending Plot Points are encouraged to explain any vows, prayers, sacrifices, or lamentations during this time). </p>
			<p class="Body">Aside from this, it is rumored that sinister deals with mecha-demons or dieties, such as a Croatoas (or similar entities of godly power), may increase the success of this spell. </p>
			<p class="Body">A deal with an exceptionally rare and powerful demon (or diety) may even allow the caster to bypass the requirement for the soul to still be tethered to the body or for the body to be in a “livable” condition. Of course, Plot Points may be spent to interact with a diety of this sort of power, but the costs would be astronomical.</p>
			<p class="Body">This rune may be used with Weaken for a cost of only [1Hour/30SN]. If used with Weaken, the target gains life for 3 minutes but is paralyzed from the neck down. At the end of this duration, the target’s soul permanently untethers and they perish. </p>
			<p class="Title">Rift/Traverse Portal</p>
			<p class="Costs">Rift Portal</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1PT/50SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster attempts to rift a portal open over their target. This rune may be used defensively. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster’s target momentarily breaks from the limitations of time, immediately regenerating PT fully and then beginning a new turn. The target may take full action as though it were their turn, but they do not end their turn until their normal position in the Initiative order (which means they do not regenerate PT again until then).</p>
			<p class="Costs">Traverse Portal</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[10Minutes/75SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster’s target, any other entities touching the target, and all equipment or items worn or touched by all targets, enter into a portal. </p>
			<p class="Body">The portal travels between the Essence Realm and the Mundane (reality) or vice versa. The target(s) remain in the realm they enter permanently, but the caster may choose to pull them back out within one hour (costing no SN to do so). </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster is able to pull their targets out of the portal because the caster temporarily tethers to their targets when this rune is cast and its effects can be undone. The caster must not have travelled with their targets through the portal, or else they cannot pull them out. The tether to the caster’s target must remain unbroken, or else the caster will be unable to pull them out.</p>
			<p class="Body">The time measurement for retrieving the caster’s target is determined by the caster’s relative hour (which may be different depending on realm or plane disparities in time). </p>
			<p class="Body">Note: if travelling from the Mundane into the Essence, the caster must have a relic, key, or artifact of some kind that links them to the specific plane they wish to travel to. If the caster does not have a specific key, relic, or artifact that can grant access to a special plane in the Essence Realm, the Plane of Essence (the first and most generic plane in the Essence Realm) is chosen as the target’s destination. Also, depending upon the plane traversed, all tethers (bound essence or otherwise) may temporarily be lost, altered, or affected while a subject is within them. The most common planes are: Essence, Change, Shadows, and Stillness. The Realm of Forms, the Mundane, or the Physical Realm are all ways to refer to the normal world.</p>
			<p class="Title">Split/Join Essence </p>
			<p class="Costs">Split Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1hour/18SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster attempts to split a target essence. Splitting essence can work in one of two ways: </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster casts on another, they attempt to exorcise any foreign, sentient, essences from the target, leaving only the target’s original source essence. This effect is permanent.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster casts on themselves, they won’t exorcise themselves but instead divide their own essence into an additional piece. This effect lasts for one month.</p>
			<p class="Body">Exorcism is simple: The caster uses their Essence Lore to cast out the unwelcome possessions from their target. This does not destroy or kill an essence that is cast out, it just removes them from the target. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster’s essence is split, they gain an additional “soul” duplication within themselves. This soul-essence co-exists within their body (unless moved, joined, or bound to something else). </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster’s maximum Sanity is divided by how many duplications they have, then multiplied by how many duplications still exist. For example, if the caster has their essence duplicated and then they choose to move and bind one soul to a rock (for safe keeping), the caster still has full use of their Sanity. But if the caster’s body gets killed (which also kills all essence on their body), then the caster’s Maximum Sanity becomes halved (because half of their essence is in a rock). So because the caster’s soul still exists in a rock, they are not *fully* dead (they are only as capable as the rock is capable, so essentially worthless). Their essence could be moved from the rock back to their body, essentially providing a way to come back from “the dead” (despite not technically dying in the first place).</p>
			<p class="Body">Splitting essence in this way becomes the cornerstone for necromancy and phylacterious spellcasting; a caster can divide their essence across many objects, some of them they can animate using spells, and then have many bodies and many lives. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the duration of this rune fades and none of the soul vessels or pieces of split essence have been destroyed, then the split essence is rejoined into the caster’s original body. If the caster’s original body is destroyed while a piece of split essence is elsewhere, then that location becomes the new source-vessel. All split essences will return to that location at the end of the Split Essence Duration. </p>
			<p class="Body">Mundane Permanence used with this rune will simply make the duration of the split never end (this will also keep a target from ever being possessed by the same entity). Arcane Permanence when used with this rune will either eternally cast out possessions or have no effect (if the caster targets themselves).</p>
			<p class="Costs">Join Essence</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[12PT/Variable SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">Caster chooses a target to join their essence to for six hours. Caster retains their Erudition, Wits, Prestige, Nerve, level, Spell Resist, and Sanity but gains the Physique, Wellness, Grace, Prowess, Stamina, and Health of their target.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the target is a living, sentient, entity, then their Spell Resist determines the cost (in SN) for this spell. If the target is a non-sentient object, then the cost is 15SN. </p>
			<p class="Body">This rune is similar to Bind Essence except that the caster does not bind an extension of their essence (a tether), but joins their soul-essence (their source) to a target. By joining their soul-essence to something, the caster gains the ability to control that object, entity, husk, or thing (assuming it has locomotive abilities). </p>
			<p class="Body">In order to do this, the caster’s has two options:</p>
			<p class="Body">The caster could Split, Loose, Move, and then Join their essence to their target. If they do this, they will be able to control both their target and their previous body (because of the split). </p>
			<p class="Body">The alternative is for the caster to simply Loose, Move and then Join. The caster will not have control of their old body (it will become a husk during this time). In order to pull this off, the caster must accomplish all of these spells at once (using Combine III).</p>
			<p class="Body">If the new vessel is a living entity and it dies for some reason, the joined essence (and any other soul-essences) will die with it. Note that a Husk is not considered sentient or living, so if the target is a husk-body and it is destroyed, the joined soul-essence does not die. </p>
			<p class="Body">In the situation where the joined target is a non-living object and it is destroyed, the soul-essence simply remains bound to whatever portions remain. If nothing remains, the soul-essence simply exists unbound in the location where the destroyed object last existed.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the caster joins their essence to an entity that already has a soul-essence, then the two soul-essences must compete for control. In order for the target to realize that they are being possessed, the target must roll Awareness or Essence Lore against a DC of the caster’s Essence Lore total. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the target is aware of their possession, then both souls may roll Command or Convince immediately and once every hour of the spell’s duration to attempt control. Whichever Command or Convince result had the highest value (against the other’s Courage or Willpower, respectively) determines the soul-essence that gains control for the following hour. </p>
			<p class="Body">If the victim succeeds in gaining control three times in a row, then they gain control for the remaining duration of the spell. During the possession, both the original and invading soul-essences are fully sentient of the actions of the body, whether or not they are controlling it.</p>
			<p class="Title">Sunder/Forge Flesh and Bone </p>
			<p class="Costs">Sunder Flesh</p>
			<p class="Costs">[6PT/19SN]</p>
			<p class="Body">CH/6 (10d6+10H) Caster attempts to visciously sever flesh and bone apart. </p>
			<p class="Costs">Forge Flesh</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[10Min/20SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">Caster fuses flesh to flesh and bone to bone, using available materials. This rune requires existing flesh and bone in order to use (this does not conjure or create any new materials). </p>
			<p class="Body">Flesh types must be matching species in order to forge them together. If one of the materials being forged belongs to a living target, then 4d6+5 Health is healed to Death and on location. One wound of any type (on location) is mended. Each stack of duration increases the number of wounds mended. If the caster has Form Control (Inscription Gift) then the forged flesh and bone can be made to look indistinguishably similar.</p>
			<p class="Title">Transstate/Transmute </p>
			<p class="Costs">Transstate</p>
			<p class="Costs">[12PT/15SN] </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster changes the alchemical state of a non-sentient substance for one hour. This spell will affect one material’s worth of substance and always casts using Alchemy Lore. </p>
			<p class="Body">The caster attempts to change a liquid into a gas or solid, a gas into a liquid, or a solid into a liquid for no extra difficulty. The caster may attempt to turn a gas into a solid or a solid into a gas by simply using Magnify (or casting this spell twice). The caster cannot change the state back and forth during this duration, Transstate is a one-way ticket. </p>
			<p class="Body">The amount of material affected by this rune may be increased using Duration, which will add one material per stack of Duration. Duration also increases the time of this rune in addition to the material stacking effect. </p>
			<p class="Body">If this rune is used with Weaken, then the target object will have its state persist (it will remain in the same state, no matter the physical or chemical circumstances) for the spell’s duration.</p>
			<p class="Costs">Transmute</p>
			<p class="Costs">Requires: Reverse Glyph</p>
			<p class="Costs">[1Hour/30SN + (Stacks of 15 Death Health)]</p>
			<p class="Body">(Note: Transmute is a highly complex spell; many glyphs interact in unique ways with this rune.) The caster changes the type a non-sentient substance for five minutes. This spell will affect one material’s worth of substance and always casts using Alchemy Lore. This rune cannot be used with Contain. </p>
			<p class="Body">This rune upgrades the type of a substance (for example, Copper to Bronze or Wool to Silk, etc). See item tables (in the Book of Particulars) for type hierarchy. </p>
			<p class="Body">The substance may be upgraded multiple times for every 15 Death Health spent with this rune’s casting (beyond the initial 15 Death Health). </p>
			<p class="Body">This rune does not change the appearance of the substance, only the physical statistics (so a shirt will gain the physical benefits of Wool becoming Silk, but it will not gain the appearance bonuses). However, if Magnify is used with this rune, it will also add appearance bonuses. </p>
			<p class="Body">In the same fashion as Transstate, Duration increases the amount of material affected as well as the time of the rune. </p>
			<p class="Body">Lastly, Radius does not affect multiple substances with this rune but rather can laterally change the type category of the material (from wood to metal, metal to cloth, etc). The material will be assigned whatever type is closest in price on its lateral category’s table, before upgrades are applied. The caster may choose the target lateral category.</p>
