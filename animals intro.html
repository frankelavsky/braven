	<p class="Sub-Header">About this Section</p>
	<p class="Body">This section is dedicated to ordinary animals. The sort of animals that exist in our world very much exist in Braven too!</p>
	<p class="Body">By the time you have reached this section, hopefully you have learned how to read the character sheets as well as navigate how Lore works. So, I only have three rules to offer for ordinary Animals:</p>
	<p class="Body">1. To <span class="Italic">identify</span> an animal (know it’s creature type and Lore type), a character needs to have a Passive Nature Lore equal to 5 times that creature’s level. So to be able to identify a house cat? You need to have 5 Nature Lore.</p>
	<p class="Body">2. To know what moves and passives an animal has? A character must have a Passive Nature Lore equal to 10 times that creature’s level.</p>
	<p class="Body">3. To “know everything there is to know” about an animal? A character must have a Passive Nature Lore equal to 10 times the creature’s level, plus 25. If they do, I actually let my players search online for facts (but you can take your own approach).</p>
	<p class="Body">An assumed 4th rule exists that I haven’t explicitly mentioned, but I don’t allow characters to roll Analyze against ordinary animals. The reason is simple: they are so common and their Lore requirements are so low, everyone would eventually become an expert on ordinary animals just based on chance and time. But in reality, not everyone actually knows things, even about house cats!</p>
