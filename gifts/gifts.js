For example: 25 SN (this glyph) + 30SN (a spell) would mean that this process takes 55 days to complete. The enchanter must spend at least 3 hours enchanting and pass both an Alchemy and Essence DC equal to (2x the total SN cost of the spell) every day.

The caster can specify virtually anything, from something specific like “someone speaks the password ‘salamander’ in Old Nia” to something generic like “if anyone breathes.” The most important thing to note about the trigger spell is the wording: the trigger will always cast upon the driving subject of the trigger. So if the caster specifies a spell to be cast “when I die” then the spell will cast on the caster themselves (if they die).

This glyph (not including the rune itself) takes hours to cast equal to the total SN cost of the spell. (If the spell costs 18SN, it will take 18 hours just to cast this glyph.) The caster must remain in contact with whatever they are casting on for the full duration. A roll to successfully\n      cast is made at the very end of the process.\n    The caster must choose which type of Permanence to enhance a spell with: Permanent Creation or Permanent Casting. Not all spells may make sense with one or either of these modes of Permanence (but the player and host are encouraged to find creative uses). In addition to these two types below, some runes will already have rules in place for how Permanence will affect them. (The rune detail pages have thorough explanations.) The differences between Mundane and Arcane Permanence will be explained with Conjure Fire: Permanent Creation (called “Mundane”)\nA permanently conjured fire will be a real fire: it has the effects of a real fire, can be put out like a real fire, and must be treated as a regular fire would. The fire is not brought into the world with a powerful blast (like Conjure Fire normally is), but rather as a soft and wholesome\n      flame. Some spells are quite useful with Mundane, while others are not. Conjure Bone will permanently graft bone to its subject, Counter Spell will permanently raise resistance slightly, etc. Using Mundane Permanence multiplies the SN cost of the spell by five times. Permanent Casting (called “Arcane”)\nA permanently conjured fire will remain an open portal of flame from the essence realm. The conjured spell will only be half as powerful as the typical rune that cast it, but it will recast itself if its duration ever runs out. Essentially, this spell is cast with Duration II autonomously and\n      forever.\n    The danger of an Arcane Permanence is that this spell portal can be closed in any regular way: with Counter Spell, Dispel Essence, Dispel Fire, etc. Some spells are not as useful (or even make sense) with this, while others are awesome. If this spell succeeds in casting with Arcane Permanence, five times the total SN Cost of the spell is subtracted from the caster’s Maximum Sanity. If the Permanence is ever removed, dispelled, or otherwise cancelled by magical means, the maximum sanity does not return to the caster.",
