        "Target gains a significant boost to their personal gravitational field. Caster’s Alchemy Lore Total is added as WE to their target for one round. Target also becomes immune to knockback but getting up from knockdown costs double.\nUsing Radius with this rune does not increase the mass of all targets in the radius (as it does to its primary target) but rather creates a field of gravity that centers on the target (extending the pull of the target’s gravitational field). The target’s gravity field also makes them easier to hit, granting all attacks (except portaled spells) a bonus equal to one tenth of the caster’s Alchemy Lore to hit, per unit of gravitational field added to the radius. For example, if 4u of radius were added, all attacks would gain a bonus of [+40% of caster’s Alchemy Lore Total] to hit. Note that using Magnify increases the radius only, it does not add an additional 10% per unit.\nUsing Impact with this rune also has a unique effect: instead of adding a single, damaging force to the attack, an attack is made per stack of Impact added. Each attack is a small object that got caught in the gravitational field, be it a pebble, shard of metal, or dinnerware. Each object deals Impact’s single-stack damage per attack. The type is typically a 50-50 mix of PU or SM type attacks (replacing Impact’s BL type), but different types may be chosen by the host given the environment around the target.

Optionally, the caster may choose to reduce the WE of their target by any value up to this total (rather than this full amount). This rune lasts for one round and may be used defensively.\nIf the total WE removed exceeds the total WE of the target, it levitates. The target will require some form of lateral propulsion to move.\nIf the total WE removed is 50% or more of the target’s WE and the target is an entity, they may jump twice as high or twice as far. If an object, it has double range when thrown, fired, or otherwise propelled.\nIf Radius is used with this rune, the target is no longer affected by reduced WE, but instead is surrounded by an anti-gravity field which will follow them. This field will affect the first attack that enters or exits the radius. Using Duration increases the number of attacks affected per stack (but Duration I and II will decrease the effectiveness by 50%).\nIf the first attack enters the radius, it will have its attack maneuver reduced by the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total.\nIf the anti-gravity field alone reduces the attack’s modifier below zero, the attack is reflected back at the attacker with an attack value equal to the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total. This attack targets the center of the body but it rolls on the Glance Table (for placement only, it still deals full damage). If Impact was used with this rune, it will be added to any attack that gets reflected.\nHowever, if the first attack begins inside the gravity field and ends outside of it, it is greatly accelerated and adds the caster’s Alchemy Lore Total to Stamina Damage done.

Because of this, the benefit of this spell is allowing the caster to follow-up and roll a Tracking maneuver with this additional evidence.\nTypically if a target binds their essence to something, they create a magical tether (like a thin line of string, made of magic) between their soul-essence and the object they have bound to.\nIn addition, any piece of a person (their hair, skin, nails, fluids or other products of their body) also leaves a small tether to their source essence.\nAnd lastly, all entities with a soul or source-essence (whether sentient or not) leave a small tether on anything touched, which is detectable for at least 3 hours. (To note, this kind of tether is not bound as strongly as the previously mentioned tethers).\nThat being said, if the caster is attempting to locate an item that they have bound their own essence to, this rune costs 0SN and does not require a Direct glyph.\nCombining Sense Essence with this rune allows the caster to actually see the essence string’s exact direction for the full duration of this rune, causing the Track maneuver to automatically succeed.",

The target gains all of the physical and mental attributes of the entity type to use at their disposal, except for Spell Resist. If the caster uses this on themselves, the SN cost is reduced to 6SN. Using Magnify with this rune morphs the target into an identical copy of the Attuned entity, rather than merely their type.\nNote: By default the target entity and type is the caster themselves (since everyone is attuned to themselves by default). The caster must have attuned their essence to an entity (see Attune Essence), and then they can morph a target into that same type of entity.\nThe entity may be sentient or not (plant or animal), but the target is no more sentient than the entity type is capable of (the target essentially becomes the same as the entity they are morphed into). The target’s motivations, goals, actions, and even Lore Type will reflect the sort of entity they are morphed into.\nIn addition, the Maximum Sanity of the target is altered to match the Maximum Sanity of their new entity type. Because even the brain is morphed, the target will not remember anything that was experienced while they were morphed.\nAll damage taken while morphed is restored when the morph ends (the target’s state before the morph is returned to them). However, the morph will automatically end if any of these values pass below zero: Chest, Death, or Head Health, Stamina, or Sanity. (The target is immediately unmorphed back to their original form when any of these values reaches below zero.)\nUsing Weaken with this rune will only morph a single body part of the target into a similar or corresponding body part of the new entity (scaled to match the target’s body). At most, this may functionally only grant one additional ability (target gains no extra benefits from this rune, including loss of sentience, health gain, etc). Morphing the head or brain of the target into the entity’s will remove the target’s sentience in addition to gaining the one ability.\nDue to the complexity of this rune (including with Weaken) the Host may decide against unplanned or spontaneous uses of this rune or require the character to invest Shape, Plot, or Gift points in order to use extra abilities while morphed.",

If the caster uses this on themselves, the SN cost is reduced to 10SN.\nIn addition to the target remaining fully sentient, they also retain their personal Sanity while morphed (it will not be restored if the morph fades and reaching zero will not remove the morph either).

A caster can only gain back their spent Max SN if they themselves choose to close the Chronocule (an option when retreiving), as long as it has at least one charge remaining.\nEach stack of Duration adds one charge to the Chronocule, while Magnify doubles all charges. Radius allows up to three entities to pass through a retreived Chronocule for only one charge. If Permanence is used with this rune, then the caster may have more than one Saved Chronocule, but the total SN cost is doubled for this spell.\nIf Weaken is used with this rune, then retreiving the Chronocule only allows the user to look at the saved moment in time for up to one hour. The caster does not travel physically to that period of time, but merely views it through a lens. Weaken also removes the Maximum Sanity rule with this rune and instead this rune and glyphs used with it just cost SN like usual.",

        "Caster attempts to bring a target back to life. This spell cannot be used with Contain, Quicken, Permanence, or Magnify.\nEach hour of this spell costs 10SN, but up to four casters may cast this spell simultaneously (to both quicken the spell and also share the SN cost burden, by dividing the time and SN evenly among them). All simultaneous casters must cast from the beginning to the end of the spell (they cannot join partway through) and they must all have access or ability to use this rune.\nIn order to cast this spell, the target’s body must be in a “livable” condition (any lethal wounds must be healed) and there must still exist a tether between the body and the body’s soul (typically the tether to the soul is maintained through Hold Essence).\nThis spell does not maintain the tether to the soul, so Hold Essence must be active during this casting. In addition to these requirements, there is an unknown reason which causes 95% of this spell’s casting to fail. (A natural 20 must be rolled at this spell’s completion, or else the target’s soul becomes permanently untethered and the target perishes.)\nThe only way to reduce this chance is for the caster (or anyone involved) to spend a very high amount of Plot Points (at least 2 for every 5% chance increase), which may be explained (from a narrative perspective) as deep love for or investment in the target being revived (those spending Plot Points are encouraged to explain any vows, prayers, sacrifices, or lamentations during this time).\nAside from this, it is rumored that sinister deals with mecha-demons or dieties, such as a Croatoas (or similar entities of godly power), may increase the success of this spell.\nA deal with an exceptionally rare and powerful demon (or diety) may even allow the caster to bypass the requirement for the soul to still be tethered to the body or for the body to be in a “livable” condition. Of course, Plot Points may be spent to interact with a diety of this sort of power, but the costs would be astronomical.\nThis rune may be used with Weaken for a cost of only [1Hour/30SN]. If used with Weaken, the target gains life for 3 minutes but is paralyzed from the neck down. At the end of this duration, the target’s soul permanently untethers and they perish.",

        "Caster attempts to split a target essence. Splitting essence can work in one of two ways:\nIf the caster casts on another, they attempt to exorcise any foreign, sentient, essences from the target, leaving only the target’s original source essence. This effect is permanent.\nIf the caster casts on themselves, they won’t exorcise themselves but instead divide their own essence into an additional piece. This effect lasts for one month.\nExorcism is simple: The caster uses their Essence Lore to cast out the unwelcome possessions from their target. This does not destroy or kill an essence that is cast out, it just removes them from the target.\nIf the caster’s essence is split, they gain an additional “soul” duplication within themselves. This soul-essence co-exists within their body (unless moved, joined, or bound to something else).\nThe caster’s maximum Sanity is divided by how many duplications they have, then multiplied by how many duplications still exist. For example, if the caster has their essence duplicated and then they choose to move and bind one soul to a rock (for safe keeping), the caster still has full use of their Sanity. But if the caster’s body gets killed (which also kills all essence on their body), then the caster’s Maximum Sanity becomes halved (because half of their essence is in a rock). So because the caster’s soul still exists in a rock, they are not *fully* dead (they are only as capable as the rock is capable, so essentially worthless). Their essence could be moved from the rock back to their body, essentially providing a way to come back from “the dead” (despite not technically dying in the first place).\nSplitting essence in this way becomes the cornerstone for necromancy and phylacterious spellcasting; a caster can divide their essence across many objects, some of them they can animate using spells, and then have many bodies and many lives.\nIf the duration of this rune fades and none of the soul vessels or pieces of split essence have been destroyed, then the split essence is rejoined into the caster’s original body. If the caster’s original body is destroyed while a piece of split essence is elsewhere, then that location becomes the new source-vessel. All split essences will return to that location at the end of the Split Essence Duration.\nMundane Permanence used with this rune will simply make the duration of the split never end (this will also keep a target from ever being possessed by the same entity). Arcane Permanence when used with this rune will either eternally cast out possessions or have no effect (if the caster targets themselves).",

If the target is a non-sentient object, then the cost is 15SN.\nThis rune is similar to Bind Essence except that the caster does not bind an extension of their essence (a tether), but joins their soul-essence (their source) to a target. By joining their soul-essence to something, the caster gains the ability to control that object, entity, husk, or thing (assuming it has locomotive abilities).\nIn order to do this, the caster’s has two options:\nThe caster could Split, Loose, Move, and then Join their essence to their target. If they do this, they will be able to control both their target and their previous body (because of the split).\nThe alternative is for the caster to simply Loose, Move and then Join. The caster will not have control of their old body (it will become a husk during this time). In order to pull this off, the caster must accomplish all of these spells at once (using Combine III).\nIf the new vessel is a living entity and it dies for some reason, the joined essence (and any other soul-essences) will die with it. Note that a Husk is not considered sentient or living, so if the target is a husk-body and it is destroyed, the joined soul-essence does not die.\nIn the situation where the joined target is a non-living object and it is destroyed, the soul-essence simply remains bound to whatever portions remain. If nothing remains, the soul-essence simply exists unbound in the location where the destroyed object last existed.\nIf the caster joins their essence to an entity that already has a soul-essence, then the two soul-essences must compete for control. In order for the target to realize that they are being possessed, the target must roll Awareness or Essence Lore against a DC of the caster’s Essence Lore total.\nIf the target is aware of their possession, then both souls may roll Command or Convince immediately and once every hour of the spell’s duration to attempt control. Whichever Command or Convince result had the highest value (against the other’s Courage or Willpower, respectively) determines the soul-essence that gains control for the following hour.\nIf the victim succeeds in gaining control three times in a row, then they gain control for the remaining duration of the spell.
