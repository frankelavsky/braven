        Shelby, I cannot thank you enough for how much you’ve done to help me. I am filled with joy to dedicate this book to you. I don’t have any other players who put as much thought and care into character customization as you do. Every character you create is a masterpiece. Showing your passion
        like this has been one of the greatest gifts you’ve given me as I work on this game. A player who genuinely enjoys the depth you can get out of this game is all I could ask for.

      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading"><span class="Large-Header">a little introduction</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        <span class="Body">This entire book revolves around what a character can do, like the </span><span class="Italic">verbs</span><span class="Body"> of Braven’s system (if you will). </span>So basically this book is about all the things that a character is capable of. It’s outlined like this:
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Maneuvers</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">These are the super vanilla-latte basics. Every character can do these things, so every player should study these in order to know what they can do.</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Character Builds (Example Personas)</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        This section exists to help players create a character that is balanced but still fun, even if they have no idea what is going on. For the most part the example builds are meant to inspire newer players to get an idea of what it looks like to level up in Braven. There is a lot that could
        happen, so these help simplify stuff in the beginning.
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Gifts</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        This is really the meat of the book. Gifts are the special things that only some characters can do. Characters have to level up <span class="Italic">Skill</span> in Arts in order to unlock these dope abilities. This section explains more; there’s a lot going on here.
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Runes</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        This final section is definitely not useful or important for characters who don’t use magic. But basically, this last section is actually a reference book for all of the Runes that currently are discovered and documented in Braven. (And yes, there are even more Runes than these that haven’t
        been discovered yet. Nerds.) Oh yeah, and the beginning of the Runes section sorta explains what magic is all about, too (in case you’re curious or whatever).

          that they can learn all of the different things that their character is capable of.</span

          try not to get killed).</span

          do the math for you (and maybe mention that your maneuver is pretty freaking absurd).

          >This section of the manual is meant to help newer players build a character. The following section is comprised entirely of suggestions for getting the most out of different play-styles. Obviously, the player is open to choose any options permitted by the game as they level up and grow
          stronger, but these guides can serve as a pathway that helps to simplify the dense and numerous (and sometimes overwhelming) amount of choices that are required to go into character development.</span

      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        <span class="Body">The following are the different build suggestions, as well as a very brief description of each. These builds are outlined below, divided by magically inclined and not magically inclined. Further details for the builds are specified in the pages after:</span>
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Small-Header">NOTE</span><span class="Body">: If the character has any extra resources to spend (Gift Points, Practice Points, Shape Points, or otherwise), they are free to spend these as they see fit.</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Not Magically Inclined</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">The Champion:</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Primary Stat: Physique, Personality: IHS</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        The Champion is a classic leader in war: pure muscle with a personality to match. The Champion uses their bull-headedness and brute force in combat while also rallying and supporting their allies with their social skills. The Champion is valuable outside of combat as well, as a smooth
        talker, excellent rider on horseback, and adept driver of all kinds of vehicles. Of course, they are also pretty good at carrying and lifting things when needed.
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">The Charmer:</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Primary Stat: Prestige, Personality: CHS</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        The Charmer is a socially savvy character who uses their words to solve problems, and if those fail, then their expertise with a bow. The Charmer is the type of character who might just be able to dissuade their enemies before any bloodshed takes place, or or least psychologically torment
        them if they can’t disarm them. The Charmer prefers distance from physical altercations whenever possible, using deadly ranged attacks in combat.
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">The Fighter:</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Primary Stat: Prowess, Personality: CRD</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        The simplest and most straightforward character of all is the Fighter. The Fighter has honed their skills around any sort of philosophy, as long as it involves killing stuff. The Fighter is athletic, strong, fast, tactical, and relatively courageous and willed. The Fighter has a few things
        to offer out of combat: decently capable dexterity and ability to ride and steer mounts and vehicles. Other than these things, the Fighter simply does what they do best (which of course should be obvious).
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">The Specialist:</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Primary Stat: Grace, Personality: CRS</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        The Specialist is the sort of character that has the capability to do just about anything without being noticed. The Specialist, while not the best at taking blows in combat, is an expert at delivering them. This character excels at precision, balance, and agility both in and out of combat;
        an errorless master of grace. Whether or not the Specialist is a scoundrel, they have the skills of subterfuge for good or for evil.
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">The Tank:</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Primary Stat: Wellness, Personality: CHD</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        The Tank is a famous archetype: they do all they can to save their allies from bearing any pain. Perhaps one of the most important characters on any team, the Tank has the enormous responsibilty of taunting enemies into attacking them instead of their friends and then surviving until their
        are no foes left. The Tank is tough and indomitable, wielding a shield and most likely a suit of armor as well. The most tragic Tank character is one who dies before anyone else: this means that they lived their purpose and did so honorably.

      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Magically Inclined</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">The SpellSlinger:</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Primary Stat: Wits, Personality: IRS</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        The Spellslinger is a practical sort of magical user, opting for throwing magic and spells onto their targets (called “flinging”) instead of summoning them into the world through their target (called “portaling”). While opponents can see the attack coming and dodge or deflect to defend
        themselves, the caster is not forced to find creative solutions when fighting high level enemies like the Classic might be. This build choice makes combat much simpler, with the tradeoff being the Spellslinger’s general lack of knowledge about the things of the world. Spellslingers are mosly
        Mage-licensed wizards, sorcerers, or Bow-conjurers (who use missile-type weapons, imbued with magic).
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">The Summoner:</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Primary Stat: Erudition, Personality: IHD</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        The Summoner is a magical user who uses their knowledge of Lore as their primary strength both in combat and out. The Summoner casts spells by directly summoning magic into reality through their target. The Summoner might be a Priest, Shaman, Druid, Scholar, or Chandler or Officiant-licensed
        Wizard, mixing their deep wisdom of the world with an acute ability to influence others. Really, any sort of magic-user will find satisfaction as a Summoner because of their knowledge and relevance.
      </p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="Small-Header">The Synergist:</span></p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Primary Stat: Nerve, Personality: IRD</p>
      <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
        The Synergist is the most complex type of magic user: They use melee weapons or attacks as well as magic. The Synergist is typically a Paladin, Templar, Monk, or War-Alchemist. A Synergist casts magic onto their weapons or through themselves in order to strike their opponent with both a
        physical attack and a spell at once, dealing devastating damage (with much more Trauma inflicted) but at a high risk: Both attacks at once are easier to defend against than two separate attacks. These characters build themselves with a steely nerve, for the long haul, intending to survive
        the drain of a long adventure when others would not.

        The Synergist is the most complex type of magic user: They use melee weapons or attacks as well as magic. The Synergist is typically a Paladin, Templar, Monk, or War-Alchemist. A Synergist casts magic onto their weapons or through themselves in order to strike their opponent with both a
        physical attack and a spell at once, dealing devastating damage (with much more Trauma inflicted) but at a high risk: Both attacks at once are easier to defend against than two separate attacks. These characters build themselves with a steely nerve, for the long haul, intending to survive
        the drain of a long adventure when others would not.

        The Champion is a classic leader in war: pure muscle with a personality to match. The Champion uses their bull-headedness and brute force in combat while also rallying and supporting their allies with their social skills. The Champion is valuable outside of combat as well, as a smooth
        talker, excellent rider on horseback, and adept driver of all kinds of vehicles. Of course, they are also pretty good at carrying and lifting things when needed.

        The simplest and most straightforward character of all is the Fighter. The Fighter has honed their skills around any sort of philosophy, as long as it involves killing stuff. The Fighter is athletic, strong, fast, tactical, and relatively courageous and willed. The Fighter has a few things
        to offer out of combat: decently capable dexterity and ability to ride and steer mounts and vehicles. Other than these things, the Fighter simply does what they do best (which of course should be obvious).

        The Tank is a famous archetype: they do all they can to save their allies from bearing any pain. Perhaps one of the most important characters on any team, the Tank has the enormous responsibilty of taunting enemies into attacking them instead of their friends and then surviving until their
        are no foes left. The Tank is tough and indomitable, wielding a shield and most likely a suit of armor as well. The most tragic Tank character is one who dies before anyone else: this means that they lived their purpose and did so honorably.

      <p class="Body">To answer that question simply, Gifts are special abilities that a character can learn. While Maneuvers are basic abilities that everyone is capable of (as explained in the Maneuvers section), characters will vary on which Gifts they end up with.</p>
      <p class="Body">
        As a character levels up and earns more Skill in various Arts, they unlock the possibility of purchasing new Gifts using their Gift Points. This section begins with Repeatable Gifts (on facing page) and is then organized alphabetically according to each Art category (from Agility to
        Willpower).
