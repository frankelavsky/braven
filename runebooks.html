			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading ParaOverride-6">Alchemst License</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Alchemist is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the outline of equilateral triangle and an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne University and researched Alchemy or a sub-field of alchemy, wrote and defended a thesis, and graduated. If there were no available Alchemist’s Enchiridions when the character graduated, they had to wait for one to become available before becoming licensed.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, alchemists are expected to use their license with a profession such as blacksmithing, tinkering, leatherworking, or professional alchemy (potion crafting and transmutation) for Magisterium purposes. Alchemists must pay taxes to the Magisterium equal to 10% of their earnings and give the Magisterium a 50% discount on official orders. If the Alchemist does not wish to be a professional, they are expected to regularly publish research (like a scholar or naturalist).</p>
			<p class="Body">Alchemists must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Class Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office. These items get teleported to the Magisterium headquarters for review. Generally, the review is meticulous. There is only about a 5% chance that a violation will go unnoticed. (An unauthorized person using the enchiridion is the most common and significant violation.) The player or user may spend a Plot Point per use to say that the Magisterium was having a busy day with reviews and simply missed the violation.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a single violation is found, the Enchiridion will be returned with a warning.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has accrued up to 2 violations since their last review, the Enchiridion will be returned but any requested Class Elevation will be denied. The character must wait for 5 levels until another review can be made.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has had violations on three subsequent reviews or a single review with three violations, their Enchiridion and pin will not return. </p>
			<p class="Body">They must travel to the Magisterium Headquarters in Lamoor, file an appeal, and undergo a court hearing to argue their innocence (risking imprisonment if found guilty). </p>
			<p class="Body">The Class Ranks are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Title">Class 1:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-2">5 of the following runes are chosen by the player during character creation. The remaining 5 may be accessed via License Review at level 5:</p>

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Title">Class 2:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-2">Granted via License Review at level 10. A second, smaller equilateral triangle is added to the brooch, inside the first but upside down and just touching the inner edges of the larger triangle. </p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-2">These runes are added to the Enchiridion:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="CharOverride-5">Bind/Loose Essence</span></p>

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Chandler License</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Chandler is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the shape of a crab with a lit candle on its back and an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne University and researched Material Economics, attained a Writ in a chosen sub-field of choice, wrote and defended a thesis, and graduated. If there were no available Chandler’s Enchiridions when the character graduated, they had to wait for one to become available before becoming licensed. </p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, chandlers are expected to use their license to uphold trade regulations for the Magisterium. Historically, the Magisterium was founded by a guild of candle-selling wizards, making the chandlers the First Pillar of the Magisterium (an honorific title, noting the importance of trade in the role the Magisterium plays in global politics and economics). Most often chandlers are assigned to governments to assist them in trade operations. On exceptional occasions chandlers are given an “Entrepreneurial” permit, which allows them to pursue any venture they please. They put forward a down payment, which the Magisterium will match, and are expected to double the down payment’s value in a year.</p>
			<p class="Body">Chandlers must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Class Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office. These items get teleported to the Magisterium headquarters for review. Generally, the review is meticulous. There is only about a 5% chance that a violation will go unnoticed. (A violation is if that someone who was unauthorized used the runebook.) The player or user may spend a Plot Point per use to say that the Magisterium was having a busy day with reviews and simply missed the violation.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a single violation is found, the Enchiridion will be returned with a warning.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has accrued up to 2 violations since their last review, the Enchiridion will be returned but any requested Class Elevation will be denied. The character must wait for 5 levels until another review can be made.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has had violations on three subsequent reviews or a single review with three violations, their Enchiridion and pin will not return. </p>
			<p class="Body">They must travel to the Magisterium Headquarters in Lamoor, file an appeal, and undergo a court hearing to argue their innocence (risking imprisonment if found guilty). </p>

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Healer License</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Healer is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the shape of a cypress twillow tree and an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne University and researched Pithology or a sub-field of Pithology, wrote and defended a thesis, and graduated. If there were no available Healer’s Enchiridions when the character graduated, they had to wait for one to become available before becoming licensed. Due to the old Necromantic Purges, very few of these enchiridions still exist.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, healers are expected to use their license as the doctors and medics of the Magisterium. Often healers are paired with fieldmages or in templar regiments for official duties if they do not serve at Magisterium clinics. Due to their rarity, healers are sometimes expected to travel, teach, and consult at non-Magisterium hospitals in order to improve the scientific pursuit of healthcare. On rare occasions, the most studious healers may be tasked with researching and publishing fieldwork in the same way that a scholar or naturalist would.</p>
			<p class="Body">Healers must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Class Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office.

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">(unlicensed)</p>
			<p class="Body">The Sorceress does not hold a Magisterium License but has somehow acquired several, written runes in a book of their own. Perhaps they are a dropout student who stole a book, the child of a wizard who doesn’t care for the law, or a wizard that was excommunicated from the Magisterium for some reason. Whatever the back story, they have some runes that they have acquired and they are not a recognized, shaman, druid, or holy person with an Indigenous Practitioner’s permit.</p>
			<p class="Body">If caught using magic by a Templar, Officiant, Ranger, or local law enforcement you may have an international bounty put on your head or even attacked on the spot (depending on the circumstances). However, some may not request to see your permit or license on their own volition.</p>
			<p class="Body">The Sorceress does not learn new magic as they level up, since there is no formal regulation to how they acquire runes. Instead, the way that new runes are acquired must be negotiated with the Host. Typically this involves visiting a sagely teacher, finding lost tomes of knowledge, or some other narrative means. New runes gained in this way cost 3, 5, or 10 Plot Points, depending on whether the runes are Legal, Category 1 Illegal, or Category 2 Illegal.</p>
			<p class="Body">During character creation, the player may choose up to <span class="Body-Bold">5 total runes</span> from any category with the following limitations:</p>
			<p class="Body"><span class="Body-Bold">No more than</span> <span class="Body-Bold">2</span> Category 1 Illegal runes.</p>
			<p class="Body _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="Body-Bold">No more than 1</span> Category 2 Illegal rune.</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Indigenous Practitioner, (by Permit)</p>
			<p class="Body">The Indigenous Practitioner does not hold a Magisterium License and did not learn their magic from the Magisterium’s University or Academy. Instead, the Indigenous Practitioner learned to use magic from their people’s traditions. The practitioner has received a permit to use their runes in accordance with any society that respects Magisterium Law.</p>
			<p class="Body">When requested to by a Templar, Ranger, Officiant Wizard, or local law enforcement, an Indigenous Practitioner must show their permit in order to prove they are legally permitted to use magic. Like an Enchiridion, when put in contact with a Templar, Ranger, or Officiant badge, the permit will glow and produce the full name and legal registration number of the Templar, Ranger, or Officiant whose badge was used.</p>
			<p class="Body">The Indigenous Practitioner does not learn new magic as they level up, since there is no formal regulation to how they acquire runes. Instead, the way that new runes are acquired must be negotiated with the Host. Typically this involves visiting a sagely teacher, finding lost tomes of knowledge, or some other narrative means. New runes gained in this way cost between 3 and 5 Plot Points, depending on whether the runes are Legal or Category 1 Illegal: Primordial.</p>
			<p class="Body _idGenParaOverride-1">During character creation, the player may choose any <span class="Body-Bold">5 Legal </span>or<span class="Body-Bold"> Category 1: Primordial runes.</span></p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Mage License</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Mage is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the shape of a single, curved talon on a bird’s digit and an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character dually attended Goldwynne University, researched Polemology, wrote and defended a thesis, graduated and then also attended the Goldwynne Academy and attained a Degree of Discipline. If there were no available Mage’s Enchiridions when the character graduated, they had to wait for one to become available before becoming licensed.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, mages are expected to use their license in one of two ways for the glory of the Magisterium: serve active duty military duty in times of war or (when waiting in reserve) contracted for important, yet dangerous tasks. Mages are given significant freedom when on reserve, they may choose their contracts from whatever is available at their local Magisterium Outpost or office. They are even able to support contracts given to Rangers when the bounty is a user of magic or support Templar when given a Call from the Holy Body. </p>
			<p class="Body">Mages must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Class Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office. These items get teleported to the Magisterium headquarters for review. Generally, the review is meticulous. There is only about a 5% chance that a violation will go unnoticed. (An unauthorized person using the enchiridion is the most common and significant violation.) The player or user may spend a Plot Point per use to say that the Magisterium was having a busy day with reviews and simply missed the violation.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a single violation is found, the Enchiridion will be returned with a warning.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has accrued up to 2 violations since their last review, the Enchiridion will be returned but any requested Class Elevation will be denied. The character must wait for 5 levels until another review can be made.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has had violations on three subsequent reviews or a single review with three violations, their Enchiridion and pin will not return. </p>

The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne University, researched Naturalism, Botany, Zoology, Meteorology (or a related field), wrote and defended a thesis, and graduated. If there were no available Naturalist’s Enchiridions when the character graduated, they had to wait for one to become available before becoming licensed.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, naturalists are expected either to do lab work, dissecting and experimenting flora or fauna (often alongside Alchemists) or by doing field work, travelling to uncharted places, and documenting their findings. Either way, naturalists are expected to be prolific writers, publishing at a minimum one unique finding each year. Naturalists often work with the non-magical universities across Braven as visiting scholars, publishing in their journals. The most presitigous journal is the Woodland University’s VNFC Period (of Drae-Kae).</p>
			<p class="Body">Naturalists must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Class Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office. These items get teleported to the Magisterium headquarters for review. Generally, the review is meticulous. There is only about a 5% chance that a violation will go unnoticed. (An unauthorized person using the enchiridion is the most common and significant violation.) The player or user may spend a Plot Point per use to say that the Magisterium was having a busy day with reviews and simply missed the violation.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a single violation is found, the Enchiridion will be returned with a warning.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has accrued up to 2 violations since their last review, the Enchiridion will be returned but any requested Class Elevation will be denied. The character must wait for 5 levels until another review can be made.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has had violations on three subsequent reviews or a single review with three violations, their Enchiridion and pin will not return. </p>
			<p class="Body">They must travel to the Magisterium Headquarters in Lamoor, file an appeal, and undergo a court hearing to argue their innocence (risking imprisonment if found guilty). </p>

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Officiant License</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Officiant is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the shape of a thin stack of rings made of silver wire, all slightly off-center of one another, flattened, and identical in size. The officiant is also given an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne University, researched History, Philosophy, Law, Global or Domestic Policy (or another related cultural field), wrote and defended a thesis, and graduated. If there were no available Officiant’s Enchiridions when the character graduated, they had to wait for one to become available before becoming licensed.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, officiants may bepaired with a ruler or ruling party as a political advisor and representative of the Magisterium, manage a local Magisterium Office, serve as a lawyer, or in cases where the officiant is especially gifted, as a detective for the Magisterium’s more difficult criminal cases involving abuse of magic. </p>
			<p class="Body">Officiants must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Class Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. Officiants cannot be reviewed by their own office or an office where they have served before. For the review they must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office. These items get teleported to the Magisterium headquarters for review. Generally, the review is meticulous. There is only about a 5% chance that a violation will go unnoticed. (An unauthorized person using the enchiridion is the most common and significant violation.) The player or user may spend a Plot Point per use to say that the Magisterium was having a busy day with reviews and simply missed the violation.</p>

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Paladin License</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Paladin is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the shape of a shield with the two moons of the Holy Body painted on it and an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne Academy and attained a Degree of Discipline. Historically speaking, the Cache of Tomes was sealed away and records of it were completely destroyed. It wasn’t until the 4th Age when Drake Centinel found the Cache that paladin licensure became possible again. Enough enchiridions were found to supply the Holy Body with 4 divisions worth of paladins, or a proper field army of units. </p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, paladins must serve the Holy Body or the Magisterium in active duty for four years and then are allowed to choose between staying in service or joining the reserves. In the reserves, Paladins are given a breadth of options for their service, such as supporting a Mage, Officiant, Priest, Templar in their duties or even protecting a Scholar, Alchemist, Naturalist, Healer, or Chandler wizard as they perform their duties or research. More often than not though, Paladins get assigned to Templars when given a Call or on guard duty for Priests. </p>
			<p class="Body">Paladins must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office.

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Title _idGenParaOverride-1"><span class="CharOverride-5">Counter/Empower Spell</span></p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Priest License</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Priest is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the shape of the Two Moon Crest of the Holy Body (one larger, silver circle with a smaller, obsidian cresent moon on top of it on the bottom left). The officiant is also given an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne University, researched Theology, Philosophy, or Practical Divinity, wrote and defended a thesis, and graduated. If there were no available Priest’s Enchiridions when the character graduated, they had to wait for one to become available before becoming licensed.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, priests are expected to serve the Holy Body either as missionaries (travelling and prosletyzing), monks (studying and publishing books and papers), or as clergy (presiding over a local parish as a teacher of the Holy Body). Some High Priests or Arch-Prelates are brought into the Holy Body or even the Magisterium to serve as rulers, teachers, and regulators of other priests or wizards.</p>
			<p class="Body">Priests must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Class Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office.

			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Scholar is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the silhouette of a curled, sleeping wyvern and an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne University, researched a specific field of study (any could be chosen), wrote and defended a thesis, and graduated. Scholar’s Enchiridions are the most common but most wizards choose another license instead. Technically, anyone who graduated from Goldwynne University could opt for a Scholar License, even if they originally set out to get a different one. Often, if the wait is too long for the specific Enchiridion they want, they may opt for a Scholar License instead. If other Universities are lacking professors, Goldwynne can be pressured to incentivize wizards towards this path.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, scholars are expected either to do lab work, teach as a professor at a university, curate museums, preside over archives or libraries, or (in rarer cases) do field work. Scholars are expected to be prolific writers, publishing at a minimum one book or volume every two years. Most commonly, Scholars work with the non-magical universities across Braven as professors or as a partner in the work of an Alchemist, Naturalist, or Healer.</p>
			<p class="Body">Scholars must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Class Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office.

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Title"><span class="CharOverride-5">Enable/Disable Mystical Withdrawal</span></p>

			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Templar License</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">The Templar is given a Pin (a palm-sized brooch) in the shape of a Pike of the Call (a wavy blade with hilt on the end of a long pike shaft) and an Enchiridion (book of runes). The Enchiridion has a chain that loops between either end of the spine and can be attached to a belt or strap for quick use. The book will also track anyone who touches it or looks upon it when it is open. The runes written inside cannot be copied by any known spell, making this book one of a select few that remain.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">This license was earned because the character attended Goldwynne Academy and attained a Degree of Discipline and then studied at Goldwynne University for a Writ in Practical Divinity. Every templar is given a psychological evaluation to see if they are better suited as a Sentry or an Errant. At no point in history are Templar Enchiridions in short supply, so Templar are always given licensure upon attaining their Discipline.</p>
			<p class="Body ParaOverride-6">As part of the licensure, templar must serve the Holy Body or the Magisterium as a Knight Errant or Knight Sentry. Errants are given Calls, which are quests that they must complete on behalf of the Holy Body or the Magisterium. Sentry are assigned to an individual expected to follow and assist that figure or they are assigned to a post and expected to help run the security and operations of that place. Sentry positions are only given to the most trustworthy and reliable templar, while templar that are harder to keep reigns on are given Errant positions. Both are considered vital to the success and livelihood of the Holy Body and the Magisterium, like two edges of one blade. Templar of one kind refer to the other kind as their Sister Blade, meaning the other side of the same tool. Both Errant and Sentry are given a superior that they report to, who keeps track of their duties or their progress on their Call.</p>
			<p class="Body">Templar must occasionally undergo a License Review (typically in order to receive new runes or elevate their Rank). This happens at a Magisterium Office or Outpost and typically only takes several minutes. They must surrender their book and brooch to the Officiant operating the office. These items get teleported to the Magisterium headquarters for review. Generally, the review is meticulous. There is only about a 5% chance that a violation will go unnoticed. (An unauthorized person using the enchiridion is the most common and significant violation.) The player or user may spend a Plot Point per use to say that the Magisterium was having a busy day with reviews and simply missed the violation.</p>
			<p class="Body">If a single violation is found, the Enchiridion will be returned with a warning.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has accrued up to 2 violations since their last review, the Enchiridion will be returned but any requested Rank Elevation will be denied. The character must wait for 5 levels until another review can be made.</p>
			<p class="Body">If the character has had violations on three subsequent reviews or a single review with three violations, their Enchiridion and pin will not return. </p>
			<p class="Body">They must travel to the Magisterium Headquarters in Lamoor, file an appeal, and undergo a court hearing to argue their innocence (risking imprisonment if found guilty). </p>
			<p class="Body">The Ranks are as follows:</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Title">First Rank “Templar”</p>
			<p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-2">These runes are granted at level 1:</p>

			<p class="Body">Creating custom moves is often about making combinations of gifts and spells and even character’s different advantages work in your favor. While basic attacks might not be considered a combo, some actually are! Even just using a bow or crossbow is always a two-step process: load and fire. Since there are two separate actions that are required, this is considered a combo attack by default. (Contrary to swinging a melee weapon, which only requires a single action.) Both of these two actions can be enhanced by other moves and abilities separately.</p>
			<p class="Body">Combo attacks can be daunting at first. But with these examples and guide below, hopefully new players will get the hang of things in no time.</p>
			<p class="Body">In Braven, almost every attack ability can be combined with another in some way. </p>
			<p class="Body">But why combine things? Well sometimes it’s just to increase damage in a single attack, but other times there are tactical reasons why one would want to combine moves. We will go over the most important (and even some absurd) combinations in this section, starting with the easiest and moving into the more complicated. Here’s a preview of what’s to come:</p>
