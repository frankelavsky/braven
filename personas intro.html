			<p class="Body">This section is dedicated to NPCs that are comprised of people. These characters were made using Braven’s character creation, leveling, shape, and gifts systems (with a few balancing changes to make level 1 personas extra weak but levels 15, 30 and 60 personas adjust progressively for gear aquisition).</p>
			<p class="Sub-Header">Using this Section</p>
			<p class="Body">For the most part, all relevant information about a character is readily available on each page. You have the character’s main abilities, vitality, stats, mitigation, initiative, spell resist, main methods of defense and attack rolls, etc. Of course, there are plenty of minutae that are not included in these pages, like inventory, encumbrance, maneuver-specific bonuses, and the full list of passive and active gifts that a character would <span class="Italic">actually</span> have at a given level. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="_idContainer014" class="Basic-Text-Frame">
			<p class="Body">In addition, there is no narrative or story-related context provided for any of the personas. All of these decisions were made in favor of generic, dynamic character profiles which can be plugged into any story or scene and embellished and improved upon. The most critical and combat-related abilities and passives are listed on each page, so that these characters can be used in a pinch when designing battles or scenes in a short amount of time.</p>
			<p class="Body">The host should feel free to customize and balance these personas as they see fit. Special gear, robust narratives, and well planned motivations are all ingredients that can be added to transform these personas into useful and meaningful characters in a story. I always use personas when a character is meant to last 1-10 sessions and I don’t expect them to do any leveling. For long-running characters that are integrated in a party, I will make a character from scratch but use a persona or two to help guide me. The host is welcome to take any approach they find appropriate for their group and campaign.</p>

			<p class="Body">A lot of the layout and conventions one would find on a character sheet also exist on the following pages, with two exceptions: Uses of Tactical Shift, Bonus (conditional) Potential, and Sanity Regen. Most of the character page is verbose, with the exception of these three compact references:</p>

			<p class="Sub-Header">Notes on Balancing and Creation</p>
			<p class="Body">All of the arts, stats, vitality, PT, INI, and their subsequent balancing, was done using Braven’s systems and then adjusted according to the level bracket. Low levels saw the raw system with a few adjustments made to weaken the characters. This was done to make low level combat and encounters survivable while making high level player characters feel especially strong against low level NPCs. The high level NPCs see bonuses from items (whether that character has actual loot or not) as a way of balancing characters without overburdening the host. Without taking this approach, every character would require loot tables and calculations before they are usable, which is too much of a burden for most hosts. (Of course, someday we would love to see some digital tools for automatically generating characters with level-appropriate gear, but that is not this day.)</p>
			<p class="Body">Every ability found in this section is an ability that a player could create for their own character, by combining items, gifts, and maneuvers together. For weapon-based abilities, there was some additional upgrades added to items at levels 15, 30, and 60 to make these characters scale with an average set of bonuses from different types of loot. But all abilities at their core are combinations of different gifts and maneuvers that a player is capable of crafting for their own character.</p>

			<p class="Body">When running a <span class="Italic">one-shot</span> session, I use personas and allow my players to choose between them. Level 10 or 15 gives a good balance of abilities that are really starting to bloom, while not being so strong or complex that the characters are too difficult to pick up. A piece of advice on this: bump the actual level of the characters to 14/19 and keep everything the same except add +3 PT. This really helps the characters get some movement in combat and still have enough PT to attack.</p>
