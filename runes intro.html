  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
    The following section is dedicated to runes, which are sources of magical power. Runes are written symbols which when read will cast a spell. Before a rune is read (and cast as a spell), the caster may use glyphs in order to give commands to their spell. The process for using magic involves two
    parts: creating a spell and then casting that spell. Each have their own characteristics.
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title">
    <span class="Small-Header">How to Create a Spell:</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">A spell is comprised of two parts: glyphs and runes. These are explained briefly below:</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Glyphs</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">Glyphs are commands that a caster can give to a spell. If the caster does not give a spell any commands, then the spell will cast onto the caster (with no special enhancements) by default. Some glyphs examples are:</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Direct:</span> This glyph allows the caster to target things other than themselves. The default range of this glyph is one unit.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Range:</span> This glyph increases the distance that a rune can travel. If used without Direct, the rune will randomly strike a target within range.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Duration: </span>This glyph makes a spell last longer, dealing its effects again each round or increasing its effectiveness.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Runes</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">Runes are the actual content of the spell. So while Direct and Range means that the caster is preparing to hit a target that is far away, the rune the caster chooses will affect what happens to their target. Two examples are given below:</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Conjure Fire: </span>This rune will deal fire damage to whatever it is cast upon.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body"><span class="Italic">Recall: </span>This rune will allow the caster to see the memories of whatever it is cast upon.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Glyphs + a Rune = A Spell</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body _idGenParaOverride-1">
    So in our above examples, if the caster simply reads the rune for
    <span class="Italic">Conjure Fire</span>, they themselves would immolate. But if they prepared and used the glyphs <span class="Italic">Direct</span> and <span class="Italic">Range</span>, then they would be able to cast the fire on a specific target (of their choosing) far away from themselves.
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Title">
    <span class="Small-Header">How to Cast a Spell:</span>
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">After a spell has been created (using glyphs or not) it can be cast upon a target in several different ways:</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Portaling</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
    The default way to cast a spell is to create a portal from the essence realm that brings the spell into existence. The caster’s target becomes the catalyst for the portal, which means that they are the source of the spell itself. The spell instantly manifests onto its catalyst. This method of
    casting is considered default and any spell can be portaled.
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-7">
    <span class="Italic">Example with Conjure Fire + Direct + Range: </span>
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The caster’s target suddenly bursts into flames as the caster brings their spell into reality. The caster’s target cannot defend against this.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Flinging</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
    An alternative way to cast a spell is for the caster to use themselves as a catalyst for a spell, portaling it into reality through themselves. Once the spell has manifested, they can punch or throw their spell onto their target. Not all spells can be flung, however. (Social spells cannot by
    default, in addition to some others that explicitly say so.)
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-7">
    <span class="Italic">Example with Conjure Fire + Direct + Range: </span>
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The caster’s hand glows with a ball of fire, which they throw through the air at their target. The caster’s target can chose to defend against this with a Dodge, Block, or Deflect.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">Whispering</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">
    The last way to cast a spell is by whispering. Only social spells may be whispered. Similar to flinging, the caster uses themselves as a catalyst to portal the spell into reality. But once the spell has manifested, they whisper it (speak it) towards their target. Anyone can hear the spell being
    cast, but it will only affect the caster’s target.
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body ParaOverride-7">
    <span class="Italic">Example with Recall + Direct + Range: </span>
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">The tip of the caster’s tongue tingles with magic and then they utter strange words. Their target hears these words and can try to defend with Willpower or Courage.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Costs">A note on Counter-spell</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">Counter-spell works when a spell is <span class="Italic">created</span> (it must be used before a spell is flung or whispered).</p>

  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading ParaOverride-7">Legal Runes:</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Section-Heading">Licensure and Free-Use</p>
  <p class="Body">
    This first section is a reference for all runes which are considered legal to use, but have licensing restrictions. For the most part, all of the runes in this following section require that their caster has a Wizard License, Templar Badge, or Paladin Badge. These licenses and badges are used to
    give the caster access to the runebooks that contain these spells.
  </p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">In order to use any rune (license-required, free-use, or illegal), the caster must have access to the written rune itself. All runes are recorded in some form or another and are always cast by reading them.</p>
  <p class="Runebook-Styles_Body">In order to determine which license is needed for each spell, refer to the individual license-books (the specific runebooks).</p>
  <p class="Body">Despite these restrictions, there are two runes which can be used freely by anyone: Charm/Enthrall and General/Detailed Appraisal. These are easily found in several different household and tradebook publications. Anyone is allowed to cast these without fear of punishment.</p>
